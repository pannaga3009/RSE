After that, I vowed never to come here, but after 5+ years, I figured I should try it at least once... \n\nI kept seeing glowing reviews here about the great char-siu wong (bbq pork king). I see comments like the best in GTA, so I had to try it out. At $28 for the made-to-order char-siu dish, I was expecting something that would be on par with the best. Sadly, I've had better bbq pork from fast food take out places (Richlane, Kum Hong BBQ, etc...). It was slightly cold, suggesting they just warmed it up. The edges were burnt, but the outer layer wasn't crispy. They put way too much honey making it too sweet. Worst of all, the pork wasn't very tender. Was quite disappointed... \n\nThe bbq pork at Skyview fusion (Woodbine and Hwy 7) is way better. Also I would say the one at Dragonboat is also better. Heck, even the two fast food bbq places I mentioned are better. This place is also quite expensive, especially considering the food is not that great and the place is very rundown. \n\nOh, and this place has got to be the only BBQ place I've seen where the meat in the display cabibet looks completely unappetizing! The cold  char-siu has been sitting there all day and is all shriveled up from rigamortis. Very likely been dropped on the floor few times as well! \n\nShould have trusted my gut instinct from 5 years ago and never tried this place... Not coming back.",

If one wants to get a comparison since Cantonese BBQ has different styles, I would point to Big Wong BBQ off Mott Street in NY during the 90's (it's different now compared to back then).\n\nMy favorite:  their crispy skin pork and char siu (red roast pork).  The crispy skin is not just crispy, it breaks up in a crunch fluffy kind of way, with the layer of fat soften to the point of near melting point but still there, and the meat is moistened perfectly.  Now bear in mind:  you need to make sure you get there earlier vs later (after 2 pm) when the meat is very fresh to achieve this desirable effect on the taste buds.  And always try and get the part of pig near the kidney area for the most tender juicy flavors.\n\nAbout some of the other Yelpers complain on service and higher price:  seems kind of trivial to me personally.  The slightly higher price simply reflects the higher quality (which naturally takes more labor to produce right?) of the BBQ offerings.  More labor, more time means more money/costs.  As for service:  I was polite and the lady cashier was very polite.  I would guess the younglings on Yelp were less than courteous, and in response and fairness, received the same type of indifference from the cashier.

Now THAT is class.\n\nOne of the key reasons for their five star award, is for John's nailing down and doing the DEFINITIVE preparation of what is translated to be \"princess chicken\", sometimes casually translated to \"yellow fur chicken\", or Gwai Fei Gai. Old schoolers also know this to be Bak Cheet Gai. Basically a steamed or poached chicken that if done right, is superbly fragrant on its own from the marination and prep, surpassing the best Singaporean style Hainan Chicken even (yes, and please don't gasp in horror that I said that) and then all you need is some shizzletastic sauce called ginger & scallion oil to dip in, a bowl of rice, and suddenly you be da King eating out the Princess (chicken that is, sorry that sounded royally rawng). \n\nEvery table at John's has a sheet describing in painful detail (in Chinese) how each Princess Chicken is made, and the amount of seasoning, Chinese herbs, and the whole process itself, is a legend and probably deserves its own Yelp review. You would be amazed to learn how extremely laborious in nature it is to make a Princess from scratch, and yet it is so affordable and luxurious in taste. Sadly I misplaced that sheet of paper, and my AZN character typing skills aren't up to par, so we will have to revisit the gorey details some other time.\n\nBut trust me, this is the bestest, sexiest Princess you will ever have in your life, tender suckalicious breasts and juiciest thighs. Most of the time the breasts end up being too dry, but John knows how to prep her to make you weep. The last time I had princess this good was at an old restaurant in Wanchai Hong Kong (Tso's) that is no longer around, back in the 80s.\n\nRoast duck here is also sexcellent and I'll bet they have roast goose as well (where it is not illegal unlike south of the border). Of course one cannot miss the cha shiu here as it is pure porkgasm.\n\nI can't wait to come back to John's again, and literally be a King at the table of roast beasts and princesses.",

The BBQ pork is a perfect balance of sweet and savoury. The soybeans underneath were an extra treat. They were sweet and so flavourful that I could have had them on their own.\n\nThe items on the main menu are fairly pricey. While the food is certainly satisfying, I wouldn't consider the price point proportional to the taste. They do have a special menu (all in Chinese) with smaller dishes that are all $7.99 that my family usually orders from. It allows us to have a variety of dishes without breaking the bank. Beef with bitter melon is a simple dish, but one of our favourites here. The size of the dishes are smaller of course, but the quality doesn't differ too much from the main menu. \n\nWhat really detracts from this establishment is the service. Having eaten at more than my fair share of Chinese restaurants, I do not expect extremely attentive service (nor do I really desire it), but the service during my previous visit was borderline rude. One of the servers walked away when she saw us come in, and brusquely commanded a co-worker to seat us. When we ordered our food, the server asked condescendingly if all the dishes we ordered were from the special menu. The complimentary desserts (yes, I know it's complimentary but still) were put onto our table while we were still a considerable ways from finishing dinner. \n\nPerhaps I'm being a bit dramatic, but considering the fact that this is not your average Chinese restaurant, I did hold a slightly higher standard. They are also capable of exceptional service, as evidenced by my first visit, when I was with a larger party and ordering more expensive dishes. The difference in service was also noticeable during my last visit, when there was one party holding a feast in the adjacent room. It's understandable that close friends or VIPs are treated extra special, but that's no excuse for being ill-mannered to the average patron.",

But a more obvious thing is to offer some value in the food you serve.\n\nBy 'value' I am talking about bang-for-your-buck.  How delicious is it for the amount of money you pay?  How much food is served for the amount of money you pay?  If you are served a truly flavourful and succulent dish that is enough to share between 3-4 adults at a price that remains competitive, that is true value.\n\nJohn's Chinese BBQ Restaurant is nicely renovated since the old school days.  However, the rest is downhill from there.\n\n1.  Food - aside from the noodles in soup, everything else is ultra ultra expensive - so expensive, in fact, that one can't help be insulted at the audacity of the owners to set such a high price for what is being served and \"how\" it's being served.\n\nExample:  snow pea leaves with garlic = $16 + taxes.  What the...are we in Hong Kong?  $16 for snow pea leaves!?  Lobster = $20 + taxes for 1 small lobster;  Beef with 2 kinds of mushrooms = $15; Fried Grouper with pepper and salt = $12.\n\n2.  Service - terrible.  For the prices this place charges, you'd expect exceptional, Chinese wedding banquet level service.  Expect the same unhappy faces serving you that you get from a joint like Richmond Court.  The owners/management were too busy stuffing their own faces to fetch our tea - even when asked.  And when we got up to leave, that was the ONLY time one of the owners/management ran over to \"check\" our payment.  Yup, Chinese service at best.  Unbelievable.\n\nIn summary:  this place does not serve food better than any other place for any of the dishes they have on the menu.\nAnd considering the prices set for what you get, it's blatant robbery at best.  DO NOT GO HERE.  How this place managed to stay in business is beyond me.",

The peach flavored beer (I forget the actual name) was not a favorite, the saison was good, and the lemon flavored beer was a little bit of a letdown as well.\n\nThey have a food truck on site, Lake Norman Grill, that serves a limited menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, fried pickles, fried mac & cheese bites, pretzels, etc. I ordered fried pickles and was given a buzzer to wait for my food. Once my buzzer beeped, I picked up my food and brought in to share with my table. Completely underwhelming.\n\nAlso, while at PB, I went to the bathroom.

When you pull up, the lot looks very small, but the gravel lot directly to the right is for overflow. Out front there are several shaded picnic tables.\n\nThe Brewery and Taproom itself are on the small side, but this is a nano brewery. There's fairly limited seating other than the bar, but what there is, is comfortable; lounge chairs and sofas.\n\nNow the important part, the beer.\n\nI was pretty impressed with the new kid on the block. The Grim Creeper Imperial IPA was well balanced and smooth for a high ABV beer. My next favorites were a tie between Devil's Gas Pumpernickel Rye IPA (robust and malty with lots of depth) and Not So Harry Porter (no trying to be fancy, just an easy drinking well rounded porter). Hazelnut Stout gets an honorable mention.\n\nNice job lads and ladies!!!",

I always ask, \"what beers are new, and what's the most popular.\" The bar tender was excited that her Primal Fest (fall seasonal) beer is back.   She even gave us a sample. Needless to say I loved it and got a glass of it. \n\nThe Primal Fest is so good.  Had a nice Amber color, and all the flavors were great.  The initial taste all the way to the after taste was spot on. Not one part of the tasting process did I not enjoy. I definitely want to get a growler full!\n\nThe decor of the place is so chill, they have a bar, high top chairs and tables, and leather lounge chairs for a more relaxing setting. \n\nAlso I love it when breweries have \"activities\". They have corn hole, life size Jenga, and shut the box!  Which is very addicting and your friends will love it! \nWe never heard of it before, but heard it's a popular southern game. I see why! Something small like having games or activities will help keep people engaged, and that means more beer sales since they are staying at the brewery.\n\nWe spent about 30 minutes at Crafty Beer Guys, had one beer and then went to Primal. Where we spent nearly 2 hours because we played games, which kept us buying more beer. Also unlike Crafty Beer Guys (2 miles up the road), Primal sells flights, which is a great start to try new beers before you pick a random one. \n\nI also love when breweries have stickers.  Something small, but the extra added touch is great. And it's great marketing for them.  Especially for us since we put the stickers on our cooler that we take to tailgate. \n\nIn conclusion, I will TOTALLY be back.  Love this place. A good tip is to try the Harry Porter beer. A nice spin on Harry Potter, but it tastes good! Can't wait to go back!",

I tried a couple different beers and liked them both. One was a ginger something and the other lemon haze. While trying to look up the beer names on Facebook, I saw on their page how they just did a soup kitchen takeover and fed over 200 people in need. Very cool! \n\nNon-beer drinkers, they do have wine and little bottles of champagne. Check their pages for updates on live music, food trucks, and other events.

Prices are about as to be expected from breweries in the area. Lawn Boy is about as close to basic American beer as they come - but with far more character. The hazelnutty goodness of Mother of Human Kindness is a stout made for the cold months. And my personal favorite would have to be the Lucille red ale. (I took a half-growler of it home on my last visit.)\n\nThe folks working here are fairly friendly and easygoing, as is the crowd. It also doesn't get too crowded.

This means the acoustics in the room we were in were spot on. \n\nOur waiter was Lamont and there were various other folks helping us out. We were all served warm buttery rolls that had both a salt and we are pretty sure bit of sugar sprinkling on them. Drinks were ordered by a few of us-I imbibed just a bit as it was my birthday after all and the drinks were good, reasonably priced and tasty. \n\nEverything we ate was wonderful. We started with 2 orders of house made potato chips with truffle oil and Parmesan. They were yummy and the perfect combination of salt and grease to help the booze go down easily. Some of us had starters, some of us chose not to. \n\nI had the lobster bisque to start and it was heavenly with perfectly cooked lobster and nice pieces of it. Others had the Gumbo (no seafood-heat but not hot), the heirloom tomato and Burrata cheese salad. There were also a couple of other appetizers ordered-BBQ Shrimp (delicious and unlike anything we had before) and Escargot(I was too chicken to try it).\nTruffle Parmesan potato chips\n\nFor mains, people had \nFilets\nBone In Rib-eye \nSalmon\nScallops\nMedallions of beef\n\nSince sides are generous, we all shared:\nAsparagus\nCreamed Corn-delicious (and I make my own just as good)\nCreamed Spinach (the most boring)\nSauteed Mushrooms-fabulous\nPotato Gratin\nTwice Baked Potatoes\nGrits (meh-but not for me texturally)\n\nWe were all so full, we only ordered one dessert to share and that was the infamous Banana cream pie. Worth every bite and every calorie-in fact....\n\nKevin and I came back here for lunch our last day in Vegas!\nWe shared the BBQ shrimp, I had the lobster bisque again and he had the heirloom tomato salad. We also shared another slice of the banana cream pie and I would do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nFabulous birthday dinner and wonderful company!",

I had requested a romantic booth and that's exactly where we were seated!! This experience was wonderful and memorable! For starters, our wait staff was Amazing! Kudos to Mark, Dan and Tyke. We started with the Carpaccio and Green Salad - both fresh and delicious! I ordered a special Ribeye that was not on the menu that Mark told me about. Divine! Hubby got the Japanese Waygu and said it was the most tender Ribeye he had ever eaten! For wine, we opted for a 1/2 bottle of a 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape that was perfect for our entrees. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Decadence Cake that was delicious! The only negative was the Pistachio Ice Cream had shells in the first bite.

Well, I finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n\nI had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. Place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. All the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. The place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n\nThe order:\n\nVine-Ripened Tomato Salad: Tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. The tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n\nLobster Bisque: Wow! I've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! The flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. Came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n\nPotato Gratin: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. I grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). One of the better potato side dishes I've ever had!\n\nCreamed Corn Gratinee: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. The breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n\nBone In Rib Steak: Server asked me if I wanted Emeril's Essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. I told him that I wanted it the way it should be served.. Shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident Emeril Magic Dust \"BAM!\" sprinkled over  the meat. It was a healthy portion and did look Fantasteak! Not the softest steaks I've had but had a Nice Chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. No Complaints! \n\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie: Came Tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. There was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. A great way to finish a fine dinner! \n\n*Also had a glass of some French Honey Wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n\nBeing A FAN of Emeril For Years, Had High Expectations..

Four other couples flew in  from all over to celebrate with us and the first problem is that they seated us at a table for 9. The hostess called that morning and said 9, I corrected her and let her know there were 10 and she said she'd call me back by noon to confirm but I never heard back. Regardless, this Open Table reso said 10 so I didn't worry about it until we all sat down, realized we were one short, and had to get back up and go wait in the bar. \nWhen were seated at a proper table, the appetizers that I'd pre-ordered were sitting out on the table, including fried oysters which had gone ice cold and soggy (very gross). We had to ask for bread long after entrees were served and it was cold, mushy things that looked like they used to be popovers (I thought I'd remembered a wonderful bread service before...?) And so on with the poor service...\nI've eaten here before and service and food were five stars. But the bone-in ribeyes were bland and not well-marbled, the bone-in bacon was 100% bone-in fat (of course bacon is very fatty but there was NO meat to be found at all) and the service was severely lacking in detail and common meal planning skills. I could list all the issues but you get the picture. Very disappointing. The best part of the meal was the fresh oysters in the seafood tower, very fresh and delicious.",

I don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so I know him as the big guy with a beard. He was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their seafood tower with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from New Mexico!).\n\nWe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other Yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. So hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. He would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nONTO THE FOOD!\n- Bone-in ribeye: Duh, do as all 1100 Yelp reviews say and get this! Fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. And yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- Fingerling potatoes- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. Really tasty and beautiful. Sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- Creamed spinach- Not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. Perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- Lobster bisque- if you get this, I would highly recommend sharing. It's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- Penis-shaped pop-overs (as another Yelp reviewer notes)- Try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nAt the end of the day, I would certainly come back for the food. You will end up ordering too much because everything sounds delicious; next time we'll be trying BBQ shrimp and truffled potato chips too!",

We had a show to attend at the Wynn so we needed to dine locally; I was debating on dining at CUT again or here but due to the high yelp reviews we decided to give Delmonico's a try.  I made reservations one month in advance online and notated our special occasion. \nUpon entry we were both promptly greeted, seated and our anniversary celebration was acknowledged - which was much appreciated. Service was kind, professional and very efficient but unfortunately the food - lacked significantly. \n\nWe both began with the recommended BBQ Shrimp appetizer - which was phenomenal, but unfortunately that's where our ecstasy of taste buds had ended.\n\nI ordered my long awaited alleged highly reviewed bone in rib eye with a side of foie gras, mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. \n\nTo my unfortunate disappoint - the steak had tasted no different than a steak purchased from your local grocery store. For the price point and most importantly the anticipation I had for their signature steak from the world renowned chef, it DID NOT hit the spot. Although the steak came out at a perfect temperature and presentation was adequate, it did not at all taste like a typical dry aged high grade meat - very bland and mediocre, tasted no seasonings or flavor. We should have gone to Mastros or I would have at least been better off going back to CUT, although I didn't like the fact that CUT brings out their steaks lukewarm (due to resting) or not even on a hot plate - but you definitely get the high end meat quality and the explosion of flavors - hands down by far is 100% better.\n\nMy wife had ordered the Mediterranean Sea bass since she wasn't in the mood for steak and as well to her disappointment it was a lackluster, flavorless dish. All in all it was a very disheartening anniversary meal after a month's of high anticipation especially with all of the other fine dining options we had in Vegas.",

For example....\n\nA few days before one visit, I called to request that the Peanut Butter Cream Pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. When we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an ENTIRE pie just for our party. It was unbelievable.\n\nAnd oh the food....\n\n** Warning: this meal is a marathon. If you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** Appetizers ****\n-- Lobster bisque is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- All the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- Skip the tuna tartare and tomato soup -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- The free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** Wine ****\n-- For those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the Fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. It goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** Steak ****\n-- Ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- Try Au Poivre style for really powerful flavor. Steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- I am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but I have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** Sides ****\n-- Usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. They're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- Twice baked potato (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. Two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- Mushrooms are some of the best I've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- Broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** Desserts ****\n-- Oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. You will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- Banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. It is also enormous.\n-- Skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.",

We had eaten at the original location in New Orleans when I lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. This one definitely tied that experience.\n\nAs other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. The steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. We all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the \"OMG!\" and \"MMMM!\" and \"wow.wow.wow.\"  They all had the filet mignon, and I had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. It came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and foie gras butter just melting into it. \n\nHave you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? It's worth coming here just to try them. \n\nEven the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was STILL good (shocking, I know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n\nThe other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  Places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. Our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n\nThe design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of Vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. Great to have that feeling of privacy.\n\nWe lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.",

Creamed spinach had a definite cream taste, but where was the BAM? Same thing with twice baked potatoes--too liquid.

This slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. If you're at Delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n\nFor starters, I had the Lobster Bisque Soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it! Best Lobster Bisque I have ever had. It came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. I am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n\nWe also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. Amazing! \n\nI decided to try the Rack of Lamb with the Twice Baked Potatoes. Jeff went with the Rib Eye Steak and Baked Potato. The Lamb was head-spinning! Topped with a rich sauce and truffles! Perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! I can't rave enough. The steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n\nThe food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. Definitely a place to experience while out in SIN CITY!",

Side dishes also were excellent.\n\nThe disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n\nI'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n\nWeird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.",

Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.\n\nEach section has its own host and several supporting cast.  Some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with him/her.  They usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.  Always different and always outstanding.  It's no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.  The food will be brought as per normal or as you request.  You're in control so let them know what you want and they will help you better.  Even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.  The place can get a lot of hustle (not normal) so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.  They won't rush you so don't rush yourself.  \n\nI go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.  I highly recommend the Wet/Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye Medium.  The outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.  Inside will be pink and juicy (order med/rare if you want blood) and soft not chewy.  The meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling (great now I want one).  Desert?  The steak is desert enough for me (lol).  \n\nService is impeccable.

We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist. \n\nMy brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had. \n\nWe had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice. \n\nThe reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks.

Prices are typical of a business lunch environment with appetizers around $15 and entrees $17-24, for the most part.  \n\nFirst off, the popovers are addictive.  You get 2 to begin and I imagine I could've put back 5 if given the chance.  The lobster bisque and lobster sliders were fresh and completely satisfied my shellfish craving.  The bisque at lunch was $13 ($18 at dinner, so a great deal).  The sliders were $24 and came with 2, lobster-filled sandwiches with Cajun-seasoned fries.  The bisque was creamy and an insanely good compliment for the dipping powers of the popovers.  The sliders were a little bland as far as the totality of the dish, since it was simply tasty bread and lobster, but still fresh and meaty. The bisque comes highly recommended - one of the best soups I've had in Vegas.\n\nThe meal came out quickly and we were in and out in less than an hour - perfect for a business meal.

It probably has some good marbling as it was juicy and moist, but it had some tough fibers that were definitely not meat or bands of marbling.

I noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the TV which soured the mood. Once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. Our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal. \n\nThe meal itself was very good, especially my Bone-in-Ribeye which is their signature cut. It's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a Cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. It paired beautifully with the Bourbon-Bacon Manhattan I ordered at the bar. My dining companion had the New York strip which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the Bone-in. Like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. However both of the sides we had (The Wild Mushrooms and the Spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. The appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the Parmesan-Truffle Chips but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.",

Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.\n\nTurns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n\nWe ordered 3 Rib Eyes, 1 Filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. For sides truffled potato chips, mashed potatoes and corn.\n\nWhen we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n\nWhen our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n\nBack to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n\nWill not go back.",

The atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in Vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? Anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. So, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. We all shared the caesar salad prepared table-side. It was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. I ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. I thought that gumbo would be Emeril's thing! It was slightly cold and WAY too salty. It was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl. \n\nI had the filet mignon and it was okay, and I wish I had ordered the duck. I can't really say why I only thought the filet mignon was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and I had just finished up a super salty gumbo? \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. Would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? Probably.

However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.\n\nMy friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.\n\nPreviously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5\n\nMy lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5\n\nFor dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.\n\nWhat was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.\n\nI want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.\n\nI'll be back.",

We were able to have a very good conversation where the whole table of 6 was engaged the entire time.  The cocktail menu was imaginative and the Old Fashioned's tasted nearly as good as mine.  The wine list was interesting and navigated well by one of my work colleagues.  The popovers to start as the bread option was a nice touch.  Popovers were \"a thing\" in my youth, my Mom loved them, and for me it's always sweet to have them in a restaurant.  For my entree I had the filet mignon and it was perfect.  Others in our party had the bone in rib eye and the bone in sirloin ... all were happy.  We ordered 3/4 of the sides on the menu and all were well done.   We all ordered dessert and 1/2 the table went with the banana cream pie and the other 1/2 with key lime, both were good, but the key lime was the winner.

I understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  I'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.",

            "text" : "As I have been to the Emeril Delmonico restaurant in New Orleans and enjoyed it immensely, I decided to have dinner at the Delmonico Steakhouse located in the Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino where I was attending the Phantom of the Opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences. \n\nFirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.\n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the \"Creole\" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nThe main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nSorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  The meal described above with tip was roughly $210.",

From his short list of about 5, we chose Delmonico's.  Delmonico's is at the Venetian in the Palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  Attire was business casual.  The dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  They treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.\n\nThe wine list was impressive and started out with Kevin's picks (the sommelier).  I noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. Apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  Their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan.  Although Twomey Merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  Our maitre d', Lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  Kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the Merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.\n\nDelmonico's is a classic American steakhouse with Creole influences.  I couldn't decide between the crab cake, the ahi tuna & salmon tartare & the New Orleans BBQ shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and I was so glad he did.  It was amazing! I also had the filet. It was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. The service was exquisite.  There was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  For dessert, I had chocolate brioche bread pudding with Hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. When our server came back to check on us, I thought maybe I had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure I was enjoying it as much as he does.  We surprised Lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.\n\nI am giving Delmonico's 5 stars, each of which I feel they are very worthy of.

Delmonico's is Emeril lagasse's steak house.  It is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the Palazzo and the Venetian, right in front of the Blue Man Group entrance, across from V-bar, B&B, and next door to Aquaknox.  I've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  Suffice to say, in the past two years, I have.  In short, I have eaten at Delmonico's 6 times.  Not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n\nPros: \nWine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  However, I question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our bone-in ribeye.  I know a little bit about wine, well, who I am I kidding, I pretend to know a lot.  Enough to the point that I didn't think I'd want a pinot.  However, it was his recommendation and I thought I would go with it.  It was definitely a pinot.  Very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our bone-in ribeye (which was my concern to begin with).\nThe steak is choice (to steal my favorite John Hughes film).\nCan sit large groups fairly easily.\nWill sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a Friday night).\nExcellent sides.\nThey are fairly attentive with the service.\nThe scotch list is reasonable.  However, I do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \nThey do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  For a heavy trafficked weekend, I believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  I am interested in trying this because I think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but I'm not that organized nor do I have an event to do that with).  Well, who am I kidding, I don't even have that many friends.  Ha!  Anyways...\n\n\nCons: \nI always get the bone-in ribeye and each time I've eaten it, the seasoning (which I believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  In some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  There just isn't any consistency.\nAll but one time I've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  The fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  You are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\nThe decor is more monastery like.  \n\nThe first time I ate here, I gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  If they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, I think Delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  The steak is pretty tasty.  Its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  Well, within reason of course.  However, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  To be fair, I'd still come and eat here (cause I believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in Vegas, I've started to venture out.",

Everyone enjoyed their meals and salads/soups. We had a slight small incident with my mom who slipped as we were walking in, and every couple of minutes the manager in charge, Tyler, came and checked on my mom several times.

Maybe Vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...\n\nSome friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n\nOne friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n\nDelmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!",

I started with the lobster bisque and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. Also two of my friends ordered the Caesar Salad which they make table side (for two people).  \n\nLobster bisque... very very tasty and rich. If you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. It also has nice size chunks of lobster in it. \n\nBoneless ribeye, medium rare...Amazing. It was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. It was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. It was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, I can't remember the ounces but I left stuffed. \n\nCaesar salad...I'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. In a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what I was told was the best Caesar salad ever,\n\nAt this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, I think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice baked potato. All was cooked to perfection. \n\nThe Service...it was the outstanding. There are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. I wasn't too sure what I wanted so I asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. I can't remember the name but it was good. I think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender. \n\nIt is expensive but well worth the money. The food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is Vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. Definitely have to go there again when I go back during Christmas.",

Cherylynn N. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  Our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.  \n\nAMBIANCE:\nWell lit, but dim which created a \"romantic\" setting for those looking for a date night.  As we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see Cherylynn N's description).  The restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.\n\nSERVICE:\nGREAT service!  The waitress was very attentive.  When the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  It was truly a sight to see.\n\nFOOD:\n**Note: Most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  Sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-Crab Bisque ($12) - Delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  This was on the Chef's special list, therefore I am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  The bisque soup is the same as the lobster bisque, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-Jumbo Lobster Tail ($48/Market Price) - As I am not such a big meat eater, a lobster tail was my alternative.  I didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  It was heaven!!  Delicious!!  Tender!! \n\n-Creamed Spinach Side ($9) - It was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  You could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-Creamed Corn Side ($9) - YUMMMMMMM!!  I must come back especially for this side!! The corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  Words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!\n\nSo I know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  My friend insisted that I try some of his rib eye.  I'm not a meat person, but I will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.",

I also tried their creamy spinach which was a lovely touch to my meal. \nFor dessert, I asked the server to suggest a dessert liquor and she brought me Licor 43. Highly recommend this booze too, but I appreciate the server knowing what to suggest. I also ordered their coconut ice cream for dessert, which was obviously as delicious as the rest of my meal.

I wanted to surprise my bf so I made reservations through open table for dinner at Delmonico. When we arrived the hostess wished my bf a happy birthday and we were told to have a seat in the waiting room. Wow that waiting room was super nice but also packed! Lucky for us as we turned around to scan for a seat the hostess called my name and said our table was ready.\n\nUpon being seated we were greeted by our server. He also wished my bf happy birthday and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned with our water he also brought some warm, soft, honey rolls the melted in our mouths. We decided to start with the Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedge salad followed by a Twice Baked Potato ($9) and Rib-eye ($48) for me and Short Rib Special ($35) for my bf. Before our salads came out the waiter brought a small appetizer for us to share- compliments of the chef. I don't remember what exactly it was but it was so delicious!\n\nThe wedge salad ($13) was composed with petite iceberg lettuce wedges and topped with apple smoked bacon and red onion with buttermilk blue cheese dressing. There was A LOT of crumbled blue cheese on the salad- almost a little too much for me. It was enough for both of us to share and enjoy before we got our steak knifes and forks ready for what was to come next.\n\nI wish I were hungrier at the time- my rib-eye was HUGE! After the rolls and salad my steak and bf's short rib looked almost impossible to finish and it was quite a challenge. The rib eye was thick, juicy and tender- served with a slice of melting butter on top. Every bite felt so sinful as it tasted so good despite how full I was I couldn't stop indulging in more. I tried my best to eat my half of the twice baked potato. It was really smooth and rich with bacon and Vermont cheddar.\n\nI can't say much about my bf's short rib since I was too busy trying to finish my ribeye. I know he really enjoyed it and the meat was so tender it fell apart with a light brush from his fork.\n\nAfter dinner the server brought my boyfriend a complementary scoop of banana sorbet for his birthday. He likes bananas but usually doesn't like banana flavored foods. The sorbet was so fresh and smooth he actually really enjoyed it and finished! With a food coma coming on and $115 later we postponed surprise #2 (dessert at Serendipity) and cabbed back to our hotel and called it a night. Who does that in Vegas!?!? \n\nP.S.

Buffalo ribeye was a good change of pace as well from the typical Texas steak house offerings.  Really enjoyed the wine reduction with that.

Remember Erik, you didn't eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\n\nThe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao (\"A nightclub that happens to serve food.\") and Cut (\"Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.\")\n\nWe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril's New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\n\nMy wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\n\nBoth were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \n\nThe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.

The highlight of the meal, the thing we were looking forward to the most, what we were drooling for. A couple of the dipping sauces were delicious but their substitute for cocktail sauce tasted like marinara sauce. Overly sweet and not a good mix with shrimp. Maybe I am biased because I love the kick of horseradish in my cocktail sauce. The biggest complaint though, was the seafood felt dry or freezer burned. We still ate it because I wasn't going to let them waste the food and was in too much of a good mood to complain, but for the $, maybe I should have. \n\nSo this trip was a love hate.

Delving into the menu so I had an idea in mind of what I would be ordering, I became intrigued immensely when I saw that it was under Emeril's.\n\nWe were fortunate to be seated a little early. The ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. The decor was minimal and I felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nLet me say the service was top-notch. Although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks IMO.\nThe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. I counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nAppetizer: Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: Superb. I liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. The wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. The wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nMain Course: Ribeye (no-bone). Some say the meat tastes better on the bone. In this case I found the Ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Frankly I don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. Adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nSides: All the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\nPotato Gratin: So good I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nCreamed Spinach: No joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nAsparagus: I'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. Had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\nDessert: Sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. Strawberry, Banana and the 3rd resembled Coconut. I found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nClean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.",

Nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of Perfection. From the smiling hostesses to the personable server, Frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for Restaurant Week. Even explained what Three Square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. He genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the RW menu to show us when we sat down. Not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (Smith&W) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. Not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. And this is just lunch for crying out loud. Service felt like you're the most important person in the world. Amazing.\n\nFrank was delightful to have as our server. He was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. Getting to know my Father and I throughout our dining experience. It was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. He was thrilled that we came for Restaurant Week and when I started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after I ordered the Prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. It felt so good that the server is all for it. Even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. So sweet and kind!\n\nThe goods... Everything. There wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. Complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. The appetizers.. My Father had the Heirloom Tomato Soup With Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich, which was so good.. I didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. He was enjoying it so much that I didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. Sh*t. I just wanted one bite!!! *sigh OH well.. I ended up enjoying the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with my favorite Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar, and Torn Local Basil. It was oh so freshly made. That burrata cheese just makes my day. Loved every single bite of it.\n\nIf you come here for RW... a must try.. DELMONICO'S PRIME HAMBURGER. On Toasted Brioche Roll With Fries, Cheddar Cheese, and Bacon. I never in my life had a hamburger like this one. It was first class, first rate, love at first bite. Outstanding flavors. Even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. So good, so good, unbelievably Deeeeelicious. The size of this burger was enormous. My Father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. Me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. I was full from eating only half of it, so was my Father. The presentation itself was like art. Even cutting it in half was beautiful. I'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. My Father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. Either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. We, both had a splendid time here. \n\nBoth desserts were wonderful.  The Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream, and Graham Crumbs had this cooling effect. It's a great sweet summer treat. Thick cream. The Traditional Bread Pudding With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce was soothing. Generous amount of pecans. It was a seal deal to a great meal.\n\nAfter the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in Vegas. I never had a burger impress me until today. Superb!!!

This was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a Vegas concierge for many years. That being said, I thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n\nWe were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. The waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and foie grae with cherry compote. Not bad. I started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. The lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n\nI asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the Rib Eye in Bone. It saved the meal. As juicy as any steak I've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. My wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the Lobster Bisque which she also devoured. The sides were OK. I had the Twice Baked potato with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n\nDessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. The pecan pie was excellent. The bread pudding was disapponting - I've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate Magic Shell. I sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Never a want. And the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if I included the freebies then it would have touched $400. Bottom line is I'd go back if staying at the Venetian but would try others if not.",

Not the best steak i have had, especially since the waiter said it was both wet and dry aged. \n\nSauteed spinach - Very good, but i would have preferred a bit more creaminess to it. Although i am not sure if it was supposed to be cream spinach or not, it seems almost like it was halfway between steamed and creamed. either way it was a very good side dish.\n\nFilet - Very well cooked and tender. I found the truffle crust lacking in flavor though, as i could not really taste it at all.\n\nAnd i want to say halibut, but i could be off.

I was pretty impressed with the waitstaff from the start. They were amazing.\n\nSat down and only had water between me and the business associate I was with.

I ate around that and was pleased. It isn't the best steak I've ever had, but the prices were reasonable so it hurt less. \n\nThe foie gras was tasteless and a waste of money. I like mine to be buttery and melt in my mouth. Not happening here, save your money. There are a lot better places to get it.\n\nMy associate had the filet and I tasted it; it was tender and moist. It was cooked perfectly, but the outside was pepper coated and it tasted bitter. Not a fan of that.\n\nFor dessert we split the banana cream pie and it was the best part of the whole night.

Being an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, you had to expect the best.  \n\nOne of my previous reviews of an expensive steakhouse stated that I could not imagine paying outrageous prices for a steak considering there are only so many ways that you can prepare it.  With that being said I still believe that is true, however I did not pay for my dinner this night since it was for Business :).  \n\nDelmonico's is located in The Venetian Resort and Casino right across from the Mirage.  I have always thought the Venetian was one of the more classy places to go in Vegas and Delmonico's was no different.  We called ahead to put our names in for an 8:00pm reso but we got there early at 7.  Some of us were dressed in shorts and flip flops, but since it was Vegas I think thats why we got away with it.  After checking in they said they could seat us early and to take a seat at the bar to relax.  After ordering a few drinks, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  (On a side note, they have an extensive Scotch list which includes some very rare 100 yr old Scotch's for $150-200 a pop).  We sat down towards the kitchen and was greeted by a stunning blonde waitress...I believe her name was Dale, but I could be mistaken.  \n\nWe took a look at the menu and this place is not cheap.  You are looking at around 50 bucks for a steak.  Most of us ordered the Ribeye which is my favorite cut of meat and you can either get it bone-in or not bone-in...22oz or 16oz respectively. We started off with BBQ shrimp which is what they are known for and Ahi Tuna and Salmon Tartare.  Both of these were fantastic.  Our steaks came out quickly and they were cooked perfectly.  The sides here are a la carte and each could easily feed at least 4 people.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes and it too was quite delicious.\n\nAll in all this place was amazing....They have a team of people, 3 to a table, to make sure your water is always filled, bread is on your plate, and that you have everything you would need.  \n\nI was mesmerized by our waitress and was inspired to tell her that she was stunningly beautiful.

While my gf order the shrimp pasta and that was unbelievably oily if you are going to cook with sausage one knows hit has natural oil so you dont need to fill up the frying pan with extra oil, someone needs to question the cooks they got.  Baked oyster was alright it was tasty, but buttery and oily as well, but still flavorful.\n  The only thing good about this place is the service.  The main waiter was very helpful when choosing a cocktail.  The servers where very friendly as well.\n  Bottom line: This place can cost over $150 person, depends what and quantity of order, skip the food at this place just come for cocktails.\n\nThis place got two stars for service and cocktails.  Would have gotten four if I was describing a lounge or bar.",

The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service. \n\nThe menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here! \n\nThe must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.\n\nThe next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends. \n\nWe will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip.

We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I've never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I've had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it.

I also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. They were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. We were seated 15 minutes early.

There were a lot of us and the staff was courteous and knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.  \n\nLet me preface my review of the food by saying that I don't eat red meat.  I know steak is their speciality, so I was knowing order what they don't go best.  I started with the shrimp cocktail, which included 4 large shrimp, cocktail sauce and some garnish.  The shrimp were cooked very well, but it was a regular shrimp cocktail.  The cajun marinade imparted a little extra kick, but nothing remarkable.  Next, I had the snapper entree.  Almost everyone else at my table ordered the rib eye, which was enormous.  Like Man vs. Food big.  The piece of snapper looked so tiny in the bowl next to the big steaks!  In all honesty though, it was a regular portion.  The lentils were a great addition, as were the brussel sprouts.  However, the fish seemed to have been sitting out for a while.  The top was dry like it had been under the heat lamps.  I understand that it's tough to coordinate one peice of fish when you have to prepare 15+ rib eyes for the same set of tables, but that snapper still cost me $40.  I didn't have dessert since we brought a cake, but the coffee at the end was good.

Uber minimal, nothing on the walls, just nicely sculptured archways and ceilings.  Very nice environment for a phenomenal meal.

Sadly I wasn't able to eat my meal or have the banana cream pie I had dreamed about sharing with my daughter.  I was not charged for my bisque or the club soda; which I really expected to pay for.  The care and courtesy extended to me was so appreciated!  Emeril should be proud of your employees especially Frank!  Thank you all so much!!!",

            "text" : "My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico's on a trip to Vegas  in July 2013 - for dinner on the 4th of July.  The restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great Yelp rating we chose Delmonico's instead.  \n\nPrior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  Our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  I should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  However, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  Both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  From the second we walked in the door it was clear that Delmonico's was not that kind of place.\n\nThe entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  The restaurant looked closed.   Then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  They looked up our reservation and sat us right away so I was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  Unfortunately, that was just the start.  \n\nThe hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  We thought it was weird but went along with it.  As we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their iPads! We were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  We looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  When our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.\n\nFinally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  The waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  Did he find us a new table? Did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? No. Instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.\n\nAt this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  We ordered the table side Caesar salad and the chateaubriand to split.  The salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  The steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  After the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to Otto instead.\n\nI did use the restroom during the meal.  This was another disappointment.  The restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  You felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards. \n\nOverall, the experience at Delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  With so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose Delmonico's.",

Whatever the case may be this man can make a drink. Do yourself a favor and sit and the bar when Max is working and let him design or recommend a drink based on your personal tastes. I have given him just two ingredients that I was craving and had him invent a cocktail for the first time right there in front of me that would rate as the best I have ever had.

It was easy and I didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. Big ups right there. I even received a confirmation email the night before (although I had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nOur server name? Michael Jackson. He didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. He was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other Pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our Sig Zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nWe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. I guess they like to encourage Las Vegas locals to come down more often. It was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. After that we ordered the Truffle Oil and Parmesan Potato Chips and Emeril's signature cajun New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp appetizers. The potato chips were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. Add the Parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. One of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. The large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\nI ordered the special Bone in Rib Eye Steak. It was perfectly cooked to medium. The thing was pretty large and I finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. My good friend ordered the Filet Mignon Medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. I actually secretly wished I had ordered that instead.\n\nOurs sides consisted of Potato Gratin, caramelized Seasonal Onions, and Creamed Corn Gratinee. They all were excellent in their own right. My friend described the Potato Gratin as the single best dish of Potato Gratin he has ever had. Myself, I thought that the Seasonal Onions were spectacularly sweet. They blew my mind and I almost loaded up on those alone. The Corn Gratinee was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. Although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\nOverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. It was worth every expensive penny I could slam on the credit card. I would easily recommend to anyone the experience. Reservations are highly recommended. One last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from Michael. That was really nice.",

We arrived around 11ish and the place was dead. The service was just not good, even on a quiet day like this?!\n\nWe got sitted. Waiter wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He came when we were ready to order, soups and entrees and a side, then he turned to leave, but I reminded him that we haven't ordered our drinks.   The drinks are usually the first thing servers asked!!\n\nWe were left alone in an empty quiet room. We got our bread from a different guy, who was a little friendlier.  But it drove me nuts because everytime he would put a roll on our plates, it was upside down.  The little round fluffy bread was facing downwards twice! I know it's not a big deal, but for the price of dining here, I expect a little more attention to details from the servers. And the butter was still frozen.\n\nMy Lobster Bisque was pretty yummie. But my Filet Mignon was just average. I had to add more salt and pepper to it.  For half the price, I could get a better tasting Filet Mignon at home.\n\nMy bf on the other hand had the burger, it was gigantic and very tasty. I wished I had gotten the burger instead, and it was much cheaper too.\nIt wasn't the size of the meal that I was looking for, but a tasty meal with the service in par with the price we pay.\n\nSo in the end, my steak chowing experience at Emeril's famous steakhouse was dissapointing and tasted average.

When our steaks came, I was disappointed to see that my steak had been overcooked - but it was clearly a busy night (and it looked like they had some crazy difficult customers that night), and I'm not usually one to complain, so I figured it still tasted good, and said nothing. But the manager, Ken, was nearby, and must've seen me sort of picking and inspecting my food, and he came by to make sure things were okay. I said they were fine, but he insisted on checking it out for me -- and in the end, even though I had already taken a few bites, he brought me a whole new steak and made sure it was cooked the way I liked before he left us to dine. That is fantastic service. \n\nFood was delicious, foie gras was heavenly (damn you California for banning it!), and the service top notch.",

So I ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n\nSoup: Lobster bisque was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  Often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  Not the case with this bisque.  A must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n\nAppetizer 1: Butternut squash ravioli w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n\nAppetizer 2: Crawfish meat w/Crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  And just the right amount of that Crystal Hot Sauce to give it a solid Southern kick.  This was probably my favorite.\n\nI did have a taste of the various meats too including the T-bone and filet mignon, both of which I recommend.  You don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.",

I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.\n\nThe three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.\n\nFor the entrée, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.\n\nI also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Crème Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.\n\nThe restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey.

However the last time I ate there was close to five years ago and I've eaten at many other places since then. My husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be. \nIn summary, I'd say the food was good, the service- not so much. \nWe were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. I was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service. \nFor the appetizer, I had ordered some sort of tomato salad thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. In fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. However, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if I would like to order something else. The weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, \"We're out of that, do you want to get another salad?\" I'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, I definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. Perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps I'm expecting too much? I settled on the salad with goat cheese and I do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads I can remember having in a long time. However, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. My husband had a pretty standard garden salad that I tasted and it was pretty good too. \nAnother problem with our ordering is when I tried to order my filet and they asked how I wanted it cooked, I told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. Okay, I know I am a little difficult but I've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, I did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. Well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. Uhhh, what? Really? It's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. It was so weird. So I was a little miffed. With that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. Just a shame that I had to get hazed about it when ordering. All our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either. \nEven though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as Carnevino, I did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. Other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three. \nI can never resist dessert so I got something I believed was some sort of banana tart. I was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. I took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me. \nAll in all, I would say the food was good but not as good as I remembered it five years ago. Or perhaps I've been spoiled by the different restaurants I've been to since then. My biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. I would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. Understandable, we've all had bad days at work but I don't like feeling like the scapegoat. \nI still wouldn't hesitate in recommending Delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps I'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.",

I had the BBQ shrimp (it's aight), wilted spinach & frisée (super delicious), and I tried the ravioli too (my friends loved it but it's aight for me maybe because I wasn't feeling like pasta). \n\nI had the Chateaubriand for my main and I lovvvveee the Creole seasoning on it. It was served with a huge handful of asparagus that looked really fresh and mash, which tasted delicious with the creole juice/sauce. My medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly and was super delish. Mastro's steak still wins though!\n\nWe also had a side of grits (good) and creamed corn (yummy). And for dessert, as usual we had a buffet of it. The best ones (in order): Bourbon bread pudding, pecan pie, espresso Creme brûlée. The chocolate cheesecake just wasn't my thing. My hubby also had their Blue Mountain coffee and he seemed to like it. \n\nI'm happy this is a chain (lol) because Delmonico is going to my regular/Yum Yum list!!",

The veg is only giving 2 stars to the steakhouse.\n\nI wanted to like it, I did.\n\nOn our girls-weekend to Vegas, one gal requested at least one nice steak dinner.  So we did some research and ended up here.  Seated promptly at our reservation time on a Friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room.\nAs others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  Not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  Our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  But, and I quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain Aussie steak chain.  Girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  The $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  Little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when I asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  For grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  Not even squash!  A squash ravioli was on the menu, but not being served that night.\nLoud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was NO decor to the place.  Maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine.\nThe wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault.\nService was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  And it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food.\nLast complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  I don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in Tasmanian Devil cartoon shirts.\nSorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.",

It helps the fat meld with the meat. \n\nFor dessert we had the duck egg creme brûlée. It was decadent and not too sweet. \n\nSince it was a special birthday.

Well, I don't feel that way so much any more after our last two visits\nService is outstanding.  No complaints when you're pampered.  But there are tons of staff which may explain the prices here. Looked to me like a 3 person team was assigned to 3 tables. Doesn't include the guy bringing the food or the floaters moving about \nThe quality of the food is merely average. 3 of us went, total bill was $360, no drinks.  The BBQ salmon was good, but the overpowering BBQ sauce hid the salmon flavor. My better half had the rack of lamb which she sent back for more cooking because it was raw in the middle. It came back hotter but nearly as raw. She gave up 1/2 through because of all the fat and the rawness. I tried a rib and found it average.  Costco has rack of lamb. Not as meaty but more flavorful than Delmonico.  But that depends on the chef. I had the bone in rib eye, asked for it med rare but it was mostly raw. The tail end was all fat. The flavor was average. For me, part of the cooking process is to turn a steak into a masterpiece. It starts with a prime cut of beef. Apparently, they were out of prime quality steers. This steak had no marbling, just huge fatty areas and lots of tough connective tissue. The tenderness and the tastiness you find in the outer rim of a rib eye wasn't there.  I had to saw through every piece of this steak. Maybe I had a crappy knife.  We had the cream corn and smashed potatoes, both were average. \nEverything here I could have made at home with better quality and with way more flavor for 1/4 the price. So I'll leave with Foodie's Helpful hints:\nStart with better quality ingredients. Learn what blue, rare, medium rare and so on are. Learn the point when to remove fish from the heat so it retains its natural flavors and moistness. Don't drown anything in sauce.  Spend some time in the kitchen outside working hours, experimenting, getting the broil and grill times right. Add alittle spice to the popovers might make them really stand out. Allow those steaks to sit outside the refrigerator to warm up before plopping them on a grill. It makes a huge difference  Add fresh corn to the creamed corn. Maybe that will add a little crunch instead of leaving a baby food texture. Liven up your tired old spuds. Liven up all your food.\nOverall the food quality is 2 stars. The service adds another star.   From now on, we will come here only for the $12 slice of Banana Cream Pie, which is to die for unless the quality starts slipping.",

So instead of Fleming's, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend's bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\n\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\n\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\n\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\n\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I've seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\n\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\n\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\n\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\n\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants.

When an apparent miscommunication resulted in receipt of Sauteed Spinach instead of Creamed Spinach, a side of Creamed Spinach was voluntarily and quickly brought to the table as well, without charge.  Both dishes were outstanding.\n\nOur Restaurant Week lunch culminated in a fine finish with a rich Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs for me; and traditional Bread Pudding with lip-smacking warm Caramel Pecan Sauce for Diane.

I haven't heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it. \n\nAs we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn't too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn't finish it. \n\nWhen I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn't able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn't complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn't order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \n\nIt was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \n\nI liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.",

            "text" : "I'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. The bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. Just eat it. Go. Do it.\n\nNow for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:\n\nDelmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  What a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside. \n\nThis trip to Las Vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. I wanted to visit Delmonico again, because I had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.\n\nSo we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). We knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good Sonoma Cab Sauv we recognized.  \n\nThe chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  It was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds \"hey bitches...I'm comin' for you...get ready!\"\n\nWe were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and I had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-American to pass up on such things).\n\nWe decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side Lobster bisque. The salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). The bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. Flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. I had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).\n\nI had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the Filet Medallions. I must impress upon you again that the Bone-in Rib-eye IS the way to go. It is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. There is nothing like it. It is a HUGE cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. The hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  I honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because I didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  I let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. We had a side of asparagus as well, which I felt very bad for because I gave it very little love. I hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but I wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so I had to be courteous of tummy room.\n\nNow that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. Top notch. All the way around. Polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. Well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are true to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like Delmonico or Craftsteak, etc. These guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.\n\nTotal wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what I expected at ~$300. Well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.  \n\nLook folks, even if you're not an Emeril fan (yes he owns the Delmonico name), you can still love this place. A) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, B) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and C) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet Earth (someday). \n\nTrust me folks...when in Vegas...eat like a damned king. Treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...ENJOY!!",

The side dishes were very good. The steak was also very good, but at this price, it should have been exceptional. \n\nThe ribeye was very tasty. It obviously came from a happy, well-fed and fatty bovine donor. The unusual cajun seasoned rub was also a unique and complimentary twist. It was cooked to the requested temperature (rare), and it tasted great. My beef with their beef is simple: it could have been served with a hotter searing, on a hotter plate, and in a larger portion size. For the price, I expect a larger steak than this, and for that reason, I would probably go to Mastro's next time. \n\nThe meal was good enough that I would still go here again for another try if I get dragged along by other friends.

My wife ordered the half duck as she loves duck. Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter.

I had a taste of the sweet potato risotto, and I thought it was delicately sweet with an interesting flavor.  The halibut  was, well, halibut.  My steak, on the other hand, was a real treat.  The bone does weigh the steak down a bit, but it was still thick and juicy.  It also came with three dipping sauces, which were tasty, but also masked the flavor of the beef.  I'd say use them sparingly.  Another complaint about the actual bone was that it kept the steak from being cooked evenly, one side was noticeably bloodier than the other.

Now I'm ready. \n\nFirst thing i noticed is the low lighting and Elegant atmosphere. First glance you would think this place is strictly for high rollers with a private jet parked across the street. However it wasn't a strict dress code.  I saw customers with  tailored suits as we'll as shorts and polo shirts. My suggestion would be to step it up a little bit simply because you are in Vegas. \n\nI will not talk about the price of the meal because when I used Yelp to checking I got a high rollers badge. That means his place is very expensive. Let's just say it was 12 of us and the bill was over $1200 dollars. \n\nI ordered a drink called \"THE BRONTE SISTERS\" that came to the table in a mid Evil looking copper glass. Then I order another and another. Best drink I've ever had. Beware there isn't any prices on the drink menu but these babies run about 16 bucks. Yikes (disclaimer: I had a good day at the crap tables so I could splurge a bit) \n\nFor started I ordered an Emeril Lagasse BBQ Shrimp with fresh baked Rosemary biscuit. The biscuits was very small but so freaking tasteful. After all the shrimp was devoured I was left with this amazing sauce on the bottom of the plate. If I didn't care if people looked at me like a homeless man with his first meal I would've licked the plate. No lie it was that good.  When the waiter took my plate with all that sauce left I felt like i violated a crime in flavor town. \n\nNow the real reason I'm writing this review THE BONE IN DRY AGED RIBEYE. lord have mercy on my taste buds.

I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\n\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\n\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.",

I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY.

By the time I looked up again, my water had been refilled.  WOW!  The waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  Then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  I chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  They scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  It was 7 minutes in HEAVEN!  The mister and I both opted for steak.

I could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  It wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that I didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  I was stuffed full of steak but I needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  We shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  The crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  We had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  I think the mister was slightly disappointed that his filet mignon wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  OH WELL!  I enjoyed my steak and I enjoyed being tended to like a princess.

After years of waiting I finally  was able to dine at the famed Delmonico Steakhouse in Vegas.  I was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nMy wife and I arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  The ambiance while very nice, was not what I had expected.  It was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered up my usual (Goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  We chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nFirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  We settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nFirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  I liked it that they brought you a single roll so I couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so I really didn't want more than one.  Probably for the best though.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the gulf shrimp cocktail which was excellent.  The shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  They give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although I could have eaten them all myself.  If you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nThen we had the Caesar  salad which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  While the salad was pretty good, I wouldn't order it again.  They add some spices to it that I just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nAs per our steakhouse usual, my wife and I split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  It wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  The steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender I am looking for.  At 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nFor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the fingerling potatoes.  I guess they were pretty good but I should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like creamed spinach or mashed potatoes.  My wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time I'm ordering something good.\n\nMy wife and I are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  It was ok but I would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  I wasn't a fan of the crust but I was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nAfter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason I had absinthe.  The after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  I asked if I could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  Instead, I settled on one and it was very good.  I am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so I really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  I still have no idea why the heck I ordered it.\n\nMy entire Delmonico experience was excellent.  Our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  The price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  Anyway, I would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.",

Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \n\nService-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.

What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I'd say the food part of Emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn't feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\nI don't mean to rip Delmonico's so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-baked potato\" + \"Asparagus\" was fantastic.\n\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar's Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\n\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.",

            "text" : "I decided to take my wife to Las Vegas for our first anniversary.  She'd never been to Las Vegas, but had always wanted to go.  She asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  So after doing a little bit of research I stumbled upon Delmonico.  With a name like Emeril Lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? I went to the website and looked over their menu.  The prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  I really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because I would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when I saw them.  However, we only have one first anniversary so I decided we should go for it.  \n\nI called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  She asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  After I explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.  \n\nWe arrived at Delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  We were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  She immediately said \"Happy Anniversary\" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  At about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  A table for four quickly became a table for two.  All the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  The serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.  \n\nDrink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. \"Courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary.\" said the server.  It was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  I hate blue cheese but I ate it anyway, and it was quite good.  \n\nThe server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  The server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.  \n\nWhen it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  It basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  She loved it.  She also got the Filet Mignon, and buttered asparagus.  Her steak was amazing, I tried a bite of it.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best Filet Mignon I've ever experienced.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  \n\nI ordered the Delmonico signature cut, a bone in Ribeye.  Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  I've been eating primarily Ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that I was ever happy with other cuts.  I also ordered their take on creamed corn.  The Ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best Ribeye I have ever encountered and probably ever will.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a Ribeye.  It was amazing.  The corn was really good also.\n\nOur server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  Written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was \"Happy Anniversary\".  It was pretty good, I'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.  \n\nEven with the complimentary dessert my wife and I couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  We chose butterscotch Creme Brulee.  It came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  It was amazing, and probably our new standard for Creme Brulee.\n\nAll in all our experience was awesome.  The food was outstanding and the service was great.  My glass never got empty.  Every time I finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  After the 2nd or 3rd roll, I looked over towards my wife, grinning.  The server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, \"You know that is going to keep happening.\" I told my wife that when I was over the rolls, I probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. It was funny.  \n\nI would recommend Delmonico to anyone who is in Vegas and looking for a great place to go.  I would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  I think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  They had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  Remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.",

The service was everything that you would expect from an Emeril restaurant plus more with Chef Rainwater and staff rolling out the red carpet making the night special for my wife and I.\n\nGreeted with congratulations on our anniversary at the host stand, we were seated immediately for our Thursday night 8 PM reservation along the wall in the classy main dining room. A nice touch that we noticed toward the end of the meal was that although the restaurant was almost at capacity, no diners were sat at any adjacent table leaving us secluded for the entire meal. We had a few bonus tastings added to our meal including two complimentary celebratory desserts. And at the end of the meal, the friendly manager who was overseeing our entire meal, escorted us to the kitchen where we had a brief word with Chef Rainwater and photo op.\n\nIf you're looking for a cocktail, check out their creative list which some of the drinks looked very interesting, but I just stayed with my Irish whiskey. The wine list is also extensive enough that they carried a couple of choices for my picky wife. Emeril mainstays such as the barbecue shrimp and banana cream pie are items that you should try at least once. The poached main lobster was a special for the night that did not disappoint. The highlight for my meal was the bone in ribeye with Creole seasoning topped with maitre d' butter. I savored every bite of the dry aged beef and I don't think there's much doubt that I could have eaten another one.\n\nThe tab was just over two bills which I had no problem with the splurge and felt it was well worth it with the gracious hospitality we received. You'll find your classic steakhouse dishes at Delmonico but you'll also see some twists with Creole influence. You'll also be assured that the service will uphold the Emeril standard.",

I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant! \nPrior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready. \nWe were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu. \n\nI decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore. \n\nFinally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday! What a lovely ending to a chaotic dinner! \n\nI hope to enjoy Delmonico again soon, and with better dinner partners!",

The server kept insisting we add an appetizer and a half bottle of wine to our order. I know its their job to encourage customers to order more, but I had a sense the server felt like I wasn't spending enough to justify exceptional service.\n\nThis may be a pet-peeve of mine, but I hate it when the server doesn't bring you the bill nor does he bring you back the bill after you paid. The runner did this. The runner also was the one who asked if I would like dessert.

We had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  Initially dinner was for a party of 4.  However, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  I informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  Water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nFood:  We started off with the Caesar Salad and Ahi Tuna/Salmon tartare.  I thought the salad was just ok.  A tad too much dressing.  Same with the tartare.  Nothing special and pretty bland.  Most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  All were cooked well.  I thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  Nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  I had the rack of lamb (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  I would take Carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  The sides we had were decent (Potato gratin, mushrooms, and corn).  We had a nice bottle of wine that the Sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  That was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nThe verdict on Delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  I would choose CUT over it any day.  They have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).",

I ate the whole thing by myself, which I thought was pretty impressive, because I've never even SEEN a piece of meat that big in my whole life.  Let alone that big on a plate to eat. But size aside, the steak knife almost literally fell through the steak once you started the cut.  I always thought the metaphor of red meat melting in your mouth was a little dramatic, but it really happened.  Repeatedly.  So delicious.\n\nWe also had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, which wasn't what I expected BBQ Shrimp to be, but still really amazing.

I jokingly said to the hostess that was not a bad option, but that lady looked like the type that would be doused in perfume which would be a bit of a palate buzz kill.

One for water, one to clear and one to serve. Maybe not specifically, but it seemed that way. \nThe chef sent over a complimentary appetizer for the table; lemon ricotta served over thinly sliced red apple and bruschetta with tapenade and pesto. (I think a green apple would have been much better. I dont care for the texture nor the taste of red apples) The appetizer was very nice. The soup followed and I didnt care for that one bit. It tasted like warm ketchup. Ew. Ew, ew, ew. So not a fan. Thankfully, that was the only dish I didn't care for. The grilled cheese that accompanied the soup was very good. I enjoyed that quite a bit. The tomato salad and the house green salad that others ordered looked absolutely delicious. Every one finished everything, so I guess they liked it too.\nThe salmon entree was delicious. I asked for it cooked well done and it came back, cooked fantastically! It wasn't medium at all and it was so juicy. Even Christina who likes hers cooked much less, said it was very good. I tried her butternut squash ravioli. It was OK. The flavor in the ravioli was good, but it 1. should have been warmer and 2. the pasta was too soft. It should have been al dente. \nThe dessert was good as well.

Emeril has done a great job with his steakhouse here in Las Vegas.\n\nThe presenters for this IT seminar were smart, they decided to make us go though a big chunk of their product presentation BEFORE letting us start to partake in our steak lunch.  That was smooth guys...make us sweat it out!  But the payoff was pretty good.  Our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.\n\nWe started off with Delmonico's Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  Excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (I love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.\n\nNext we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  Seeing as I was in a steakhouse and that I-like-a-the-beef, I naturally went for a steak.  On the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled USDA prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  Got mine in a nice medium rare.  Boy oh boy, was this a winner!  Tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent I say.  I usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, I did not need it!  I sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  The side of Country Smashed Potatoes were good too, but you can guarantee I kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  It's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks I've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  I took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  Delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.\n\nWe ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, I cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because I really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  But yes, that tart must have been pretty good because I do remember finishing that as well!\n\nQuickly looking at the actual menu, Delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  Most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  Not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!

The lobster bisque arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  It was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  The petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  I finished with the Halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  It was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but I enjoyed it.  \n\nThe rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  I did try a bit of my GF's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  The ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  \n\nOverall, especially for the price, I thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just OK.  Not a place I'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, I don't think this really hits the mark.

Tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  Not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  Service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  Forgot our truffle potato chips and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.\n\nNot sure I'd go back with all the other many celebrity chef restaurants to try, but it's definitely one of the better ones.",

We began our meal with bbq shrimp, bone-in bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were delicious.  Now on to the steaks. We ordered bone-in ribeyes and this was by far the best steak I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. For our sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  We finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n\nLet's talk about the staff and the service.  From the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  The three gentlemen serving us were Rene, Brian, and David, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  They were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n\nThe ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  We had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n\nDefinitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. We will definitely be back.",

            "text" : "Emeril's Delmonico Steakhouse is located in the Venetian hotel, slightly across from the Blue Man Group Theatre. To be honest, I even liked Chef Emeril much. Never cared about his shows or his cooking. Guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at Delmonico. We made reservations through Open Table for a party of 12 on a Saturday night. We wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (FYI, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). We weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. Gave us plenty of time to digest and chill. \n\nWe checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. Barely five minutes passed and our maître d' came out to fetch us. Unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. However, he took care of us the entire night. I apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: Caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him. \n\nThe establishment is quite simple but still very classy. It's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. The dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. You can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. It's an elegant and clean look.\n\nWe all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. We figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. After recently having some awesome buffalo in Wyoming, I decided to order the Three Peppercorn Crusted American Buffalo Rib-eye with Caramelized Cipollini Onions and Brandy Peppercorn reduction ($50). For those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. It well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. Personally, medium rare is the way to go. I sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and I have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. A few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. Not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.\n\nFor sides, we ordered two of the following to share: Sautéed Garlic Wild Mushrooms ($11), New Orleans Creamed Spinach ($9), and the Creamed Corn Gratinee ($11). It was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. All sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.\n\nEverything could not have gone smoother. The 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. Service was top notch. Occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. Our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. The chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. That could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. Even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house Delmonico is. I am quite impressed with what Chef Emeril has done with this restaurant. Big Props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. I do look forward to future visits.",

I suppose it's not new and hot, so it's relatively simple to get a table during a desired time. \n\nWe had solid service. Everyone was so nice, even after we decline getting wine after many minutes of searching through the list and talking to a sommelier. Yep, we were those people. \n\nWe ordered: \nthe ribeye (25oz) which was split for us two\nthe wilted spinach salad\nbarbecue shrimp appetizer \nRoasted fingerling potatoes\nkey lime pie desert.\n\nThe wilted salad wasn't wilted bc we asked for the dressing on the side, but it was pretty good. I didn't love it bc of the bacon fat vinaigrette, but the fried egg was an interesting touch. The portion is quite small, so not really that shareable if you're wanting to get some greens in your diet. \n\nThe barbecue shrimp was fantastic. It comes at a hefty price of $18 for five shrimp, but it's pretty worth it. The shrimp were juicy and plump and very flavorful. It's more Cajun/new orleans style, so don't think it's some traditional southern sweet BBQ. \n\nThe steak was delectable. It had a perfect crisp layer on the outside and a good medium rare redness on the inside. For the most part, it was really a good marbled piece of meat. Even at 12 oz each, I could barely finish it, but I was riding on the potatoes...\n\nWhich were pretty bomb too. Steeped with garlic and herbs and butter, these potatoes were cute and perfectly seasoned and cooked. Just soft enough to melt in your mouth but cooked enough to have some of a give when you take your initial bite. Definitely recommend these. \n\nAnd of course, seriously, the best is for last: the key lime pie. Trust me, I'm not a huge sweet tooth (even though I love love ice cream - it doesn't necessarily mean I love super sweet things!) and I don't often tend to like tart flavor profiles, but this was the damn best key lime pie I've ever had. We were recommended several things like the banana something something and blah blah blah and we both just happened to lock our eyes on the key lime - maybe we needed a refreshing dessert - but it was a good choice. By no means do I not think the others are good too - I bet they are - but this was the best choice for us! It was the right amount of tartness with the sweet (though it was a bit heavy on the sugar for my liking) and the strawberry glaze was so complementary. The crust was buttery and delicious and it all paired so well together! Goodness, the ghrelin hormones are starting to rise and they're making me hungry for this dessert! \n\nDelmonico's is a great steak place, maybe one of the best.

This was apparent after she ordered it \"medium well\" and I shot her a look and remark of \"I don't want mine medium well, I want it medium rare\" This minor conflict turned uncomfortable for the rest of my family as her and I debated over how our steak should be cooked. (My theory - anything over medium kills the good juicy flavor) All the while the waitress was standing there, listening to us go back and forth about the steak. I don't remember how it ended up being cooked, but I do remember the steak coming out cut in half. Thanks waitress. \n\nThe food was good, I think everyone was pretty content with what they ordered.

Not just the price, but also the entrees and sides, the pairing with wine, the atmosphere waiting in line.\n\nI personally liked the atmosphere, as it was nice to have dim lighting for a late 9pm dinner. The waiting bar was nice, although the seats are very very low. A nice confidence booster for short folks, but some might find it uncomfortable. \n\nInside the restaurant, seats are very comfortable. Unlike my counterparts Don and Elmer, I ordered the standard NY bone-in steak. Very good, my only complaint was that it wasn't boneless! The wine was great; the waiter was helpful in selecting a bottle, very tasty but not too pricey for 4 near-thirtysomethings. The side dish of warm spinach salad(which yours truly ordered) was the showstealer of the night. Everyone liked it, so keep it on your radar if you go.\n \nOverall, I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars, though it would really be 3 and a half stars. If you want a better selection of steaks, probably go to Ruth Chris, NERO or the Bradley Ogden restaurants. In Vegas, the benchmark is BOA, but BOA can get very very pricey. But for the value and overall celebrity restaurant experience, a good experience. Definitely make reservations thru the casino or through opentable. I would go again with a small group or for an intimate dinner with my girlfriend.",

Anyone with an unbent iPhone 6+ can snap selfies and food pics these days, but you need just a little more than reservations for this opportunity. \n\nOur group was ushered through the dining room and towards the kitchen door, then guided into a side room that was separated from the dining room area.

The steaks came out super fast and were unfortunately super rare. My wife decided to eat hers, but I sent mine back. My steak came back closer to medium rare than medium, and the flavor was gone. I waited at least ten minutes for the steak to come back, and it was a miss. On top of that, my filet's cut was poor. The sides were fine - mushrooms and twice baked potato.\n\nI kind of felt that the kitchen and management really blew this for us. At a place with a price point like this, walking in just before closing shouldn't impact the food quality. I feel like the kitchen wanted the steak out ASAP so they could shut down for he night. On top of that, no manager came to say a word about the mistake, and nothing was done to compensate for it - no comped drink or dessert or even a \"sorry\" from the management.

            "text" : "I'll start with this: I'm not a fan of Emeril Lagasse.\n\nWhy? I don't know. I've never really been a fan. When Food Network showed actual shows instead of Guy Fieri and his 90's hair, Emeril, Bobby Flay, Tyler Florence, and Giada ruled the network. Oh, and Michael Chiarello, but I've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. That aside, BAM! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now Emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. I always thought he was off-putting.\n\nThat being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. I've been to CUT, so I know that Wolfgang Puck is better than his canned soups. There's a chance Emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n\nThe drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. Maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n\nFirst up: the vine-ripened heirloom tomato salad with burrata. Am I supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? Are you serious? I paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? Fuckin hell. I was disappointed. Okay? So disappointed. Come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a RIPE tomato?\n\nFor the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the ahi tuna. The tuna was fine - it was tuna. I'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). The battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n\nBut the wagyu. Okay, look. You're paying $90 for a fucking steak. For a steak that ISN'T KOBE - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. And it's not big, it's small. Is it wonderfully marbled with fat? Yes! To me, it was great! I thought it was wonderful! But this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n\nWhen you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. Like, searing hot. Like on a 400F plate like Mastros, hot. RIGHT off the goddamn pan hot. When it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? What kind of $90 experience is that? The cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you RUIN the experience. Plus it was a little too salty.\n\nYou're probably thinking, \"Jesus Jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. I can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here.\"\n\nYeah, alright. I'll give you that. But you know what? I'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated PERFECTLY. I can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, I don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n\nThen, to top off the evening of great disappointments, I ordered dessert. How HARD is it to fuck this up? When you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? So you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? For fucks sake people, GREAT dessert isn't that hard! It's SO EASY. Even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! If you call that Chocolate Truffle Cake a CAKE when it's drier than the Sahara desert, and that Strawberry Shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, AND the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your Pastry Chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n\nThis is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the Strip.",

Make sure you ask the server for this menu because it's only listed on a sign outside but not found anywhere on the menu. I had the tomato soup with ricotta grilled cheese. By far, best tomato soup I have ever had. My boyfriend and I also ordered different types of steaks. We ordered them to be cooked medium rare. His came out perfect- pink all the way through, juicy tender. However, mine was VERY rare- like almost a shade of blue. For a steakhouse, this is VERY disappointing. The other issue with this is after we received our food no one checked in and it took a while for me to flag down one of our servers (we had three servers/workers for our table). So my boyfriend was almost done with his steak before we were even checked on and received a new one. Manager did come over and apologize for but a steakhouse in Vegas, I feel the temperature of a steak has to be on point. \n\nFor desserts, we ordered the pecan pie.

Because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. It was very cool. We did the tasting menu.

I thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but I wasn't the only one at dinner). I thought the BBQ shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. Split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. I had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. Delicous!

Someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). All of us enjoyed our meals. I think it's a nice little \"splurge\" for dinner. \n\nI do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses. I didn't see that \"wow\" factor onthe menu...which is why I ordered one of the specials.",

But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.",

The typical blue cheese wedge is so decadent with large chunks of cheese and caramelized bacon, all other wedge salads will not do it for you in the future.  The lobster bisque is sweet and creamy and is a must have each time you go.  \n\nImportant hint: don't pass up dessert - a true quality restaurant will have a well rounded and exciting dessert menu.

After we were seated a group of 6 came in wearing t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and flip flops. Oh well, that's Vegas for you.\n\nInstead of the usual bread basket, the wait staff would place a warm roll on your plate when needed. It was one of the best rolls I've had in a while. A warm soft roll with a sprinkle of salt on top. We ordered for an appetizer, the Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare Cucumber Salad and Wasabi Aioli. I thought it was a bit salty, but the bf thought otherwise. We still scarfed it down. Because it was a busy night, we did have to wait a bit between the appetizer and our entrees. But the wait staff was very attentive most other times. \n\nThe bf ordered the Filet Mignon. He said it was very tasty and melted in his mouth. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Colorado Lamb, Fresh Herb Popover and Black Truffle Reduction. By far the best lamb I have ever had. Previous times when I ordered lamb, it had a gamey taste. For a second, I thought I was eating filet mignon. The Black Truffle reduction has a nice addition. It did not cover up the taste of the lamb. The popover was light and airy and tasted of rosemary.  We shared the New Orleans Style Creamed Spinach as a side. It was rich, creamy and delicious. I didn't get to finish my cocktail by the end, so the waiter placed it in a \"to-go\" cup.

My wife's pork chop was huge, but virtually raw in the center.  The server explained to us that this was the \"correct\" way to serve pork nowadays.  Apparently we're behind the times, because we prefer not to eat raw pork.  She did enjoy the part of the chop that was cooked, though.  By the way, my steak was a bit more than lukewarm.  I kind of like steak that's hot.\n\nThe restaurant was very loud, and became substantially noisier as the table of eight drunks behind us got more and more drunk.  Shouting, screaming, maniacal laughter filled the section of the restaurant where we, unfortunately, were seated near them.  No one from the Delmonico's staff or management did anything to ameliorate this situation, and the drunks stayed (and got louder) long after they had finished eating.  But not finished drinking.\n\nThis is one of those steak houses where there's a primary server and then a team of two or three ancillary servers.  None of them were initially friendly, although the primary server warmed up a bit.  The others came and went almost instantaneously, with minimal contact.  For example, one server brought a couple of small popovers for each of us.  Almost tossing them onto plates, he muttered \"Enjoy your bread\" -- and was gone.

I went with a group for a friend's birthday, but wasn't concerned about finding food because I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one fantastic chicken or fish option. Umm...I found that place. The only non-red meat option on the menu was a bacon-wrapped halibut and I don't eat pork either (I know, I'm annoying). I asked if I could have the halibut without bacon and they told me they would have to unwrap it, but sure. Which meant my ridiculously expensive dinner consisted of a dry rock which might have once been halibut that tasted strongly of bacon. Now, I know it was a steakhouse and I shouldn't hold it against them that they aren't prepared to deal with a semi-vegetarian, but they should at least be prepared to make halibut that doesn't have the consistency of a rock. And I also wasn't impressed with the service. They got down the whole 8 waiters at a time delivering everybody's food thing, but our waiter wasn't particularly knowledgeable about the wine or the menu, except to push \"Emeril's specialties.\" And seeing as how Emeril isn't actually back there, I don't really care what are his specialities. The decor does make the most of an underground space, but the lack of windows made me genuinely claustrophobic by the end of the night. Overall, I was really dissapointed. I'd give it one star, but I don't think that's fair because, again, I'm not their target audience. But that doesn't mean I'm not paying as much as everybody else!",

This is my splurge dinner on this vacation. I'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. I had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. Not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a \"thank you for waiting.\" I also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. My soda glass sat empty for a long time before I was asked if I wanted another. This happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. No mention of whether I would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  Either assume that I would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that I'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. I also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. Just because I'm by myself doesn't mean I don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. I was asked if I wanted another after I was done, and I declined. It was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  My appetizer was completely delicious. I am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. It was lump crab and gnocchi. Pesto, brown butter, lemon. The crab tasted like Dungeness, the best of course. The gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that I could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  Next came the rib eye, medium, and creamed corn gratinee. The corn was good. The topping was crispy. The steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. I expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. There were bites that I felt I was choking down. I also found it to be underseasoned. When I asked for sauces, I was given three options. Bearnaise, Emeril style A-1, and something muttered of which I only heard worcestershire. I think it might have been just that. I opted for the E-1. It didn't solve the seasoning issue and I found the taste odd.  The verdict is in on the diet coke. It was three dollars and I was not charged for refills. Why keep asking then?

Pair with steak very well.\n\nBone in rib eye: Nice big piece of steak with a bit of fat, which is the way I like my steak. \n\nChateaubriand: 2 big pieces of fillet Mignon that also comes with a side of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes finished at table side for two people. Fillet was SO tender and juicy, probably one of the best I've had! Not an asparagus person so it was bleh. Mashed potatoes were ok. \n\nI would love to go back again with my boyfriend and have a romantic dinner.",

When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you're inside a European gallery. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you're into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I've had. \n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn't expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that's was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \n\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.",

No. No. No.  Let's recap why.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. When we got there a few minutes early for a reservation, I let them know we would wait for a good table. Instead, the hostess tried to sit us at a table next to a portable cooking station and this little room where the waiters get extra plates, forks, etc. Worst seat in the house. No joke. It was after 10 p.m. on a Friday. The place WAS packed, but there were a few better tables left. Why do us like this?\n\nSo we ask for a better table. Hostess walks us all the way back out of the dining room, looks at computer, walks us all the way back into dining room, this time to sit us near the open backdoor that patrons use to go to the bathroom and the waitstaff uses to hide in in between orders. It's January. So clearly this is a great idea. NOT.\n\nI was so angry I almost walked out right then. I could understand if it was 8 p.m. and those free, better tables were being saved for someone. But it was late. We were the last customers of the night. Give us the best, free table, you idiot!\n\nAnyhizzle, our waiter shows up and man is amazing. He reads us the whole menu, which usually I hate, but he was so charming, it was OK.  Loved him. Best part of the entire night.\n\nSo they start us with a complimentary  amuse-bouche, which was declicious. So second best part of the night. And that basically concludes are positives.\n\nThe bread was so boring I thought it was running for office. \n\nMy wine tasted as if the bottle had been opened the week before. When I complained ONLY because I was asked if I liked it, the amazing waiter brought me two other wines to try. Im telling you, best waiter ever. But the wines all tasted rancid. I didn't tell him this because I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just sipped happily cuz it is Vegas and the point is to drink, OK?\n\nWe started with the lobster bisque (I've tasted better lobster broth at Whole Foods and the lobster was hard) and a mushy tomato salad.\n\n Then we shared some crazy 32-ounce ribeye that came with a puff pastry and bone marrow. I love marrow, but this was gross. And the ribeye had no taste at all. No salt. No pepper. Just grease. Where's the BAM, Emeril? Also, the steak was so hard and not medium rare, as we ordered it. \n\nThe waiter recommended the potatoes gratin. Dude, I've made better gratin drunk. The potatoes were still hard and it tasted like pure garlic. I love garlic, but this was like Buffy the Vampire Slayer killing a villian garlic. \n\nSo we left. The check wasn't bad for Vegas. \n\nBut for a special night out? Not worth your time.\n\nI like StripSteak at Mandalay so much more. While it does have THE shittiest service, the steaks are like butter and the sides are to die for.",

The service was  outstanding and so was the food. My sister and I had to split a T-bone steak because it was so big. We devoured it in about 3 minutes because it just melted. It was seasoned perfectly and the side orders we picked came in generous portions (we had to take them home).  My grandfather loved the salad he kept saying it was exactly what he was craving. It was the first time I'd eaten a correctly made caesar and it was extremely well flavored. Everyone was so stuffed and we had tons of food left over. As I stated before the service was outstanding I day this because my grandfather started feeling pain and needed to be taken home to have his medication immediately. They let half of us leave to escort him to our ride and we hadn't even paid or bill. They discreetly packed up or food and took our payment after they were sure his situation was handled, they even offered to have security bring a wheel chair and escort us out the Venetian.

I'm a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus.

We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \n\nThe service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don't remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name. \n\nVery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo's craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \n\nMy dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n\nI had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n\nWith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n\nAbout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them.

Sent steak back, not cooked as requested. Waited 20 mins for waiter to bring steak back. When plate was returned steak was dry, burned and the items left on dinner plate where ice cold. Husband ate dinner alone while I waited for my $52 steak. An apology was never extended. Dinner was definitely not worth the $200 check. Very Disappointed!

We had two bone-in rib eyes ($55 each, probably about 20 oz. each), the flounder ($40), BBQ salmon ($36), sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the mashed potatoes.  It had a pasty texture to it.  I prefer my mashed potatoes fluffy.  We topped off the night with a slice of the banana cream pie.  OMG -- I had it three years ago on another visit and hadn't stopped thinking about it.  I wish we hadn't ordered so many entrees so I could have had my own slice!\n\nWe asked for both steaks to be cooked medium.  It was a PERFECT medium!\n\nI seriously can't wait to go back to Vegas.

I've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing Yelp reviews, I went into this a little uneasy.\n\nMy boyfriend had paid for most of our Vegas trip, so I wanted to treat him to something special. This most definitely was.\n\nWe made reservations that morning (Thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. We arrived and were quickly seated. The decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n\nThe service was impeccable. We had three waiters taking care of us! Water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. I asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. I really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n\nLovely bathrooms though, but I expected that. A nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n\nBut now, to the main attraction: the food. Oh dear God, the food. We started with the truffle parmesan potato chips. So simple, but sooooo good.\n\nI got a rare filet mignon and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. We got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. They were good, but could have used more bacon. Then again, I think everything could use more bacon.\n\nThe meat was... quite literally the best I ever had. I love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until I cut into the steak. Chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. It was kinda Cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. It was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n\nWe surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. I went for my old standby, the creme brulee. The boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n\nCan't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. The sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. Chocolatey, but not sweet. I could snack on them all day.\n\nBut the root beer float was a work of art. Came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. Waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n\nMy boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. He used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. And he is still going crazy over that float. I think that speaks for itself.\n\nSo while at first I might have been apprehensive, I'm really glad we came here. It's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but I definitely won't forget it.",

Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\n\nWhat we put in our tummies:\n(pictures posted)\n\n1st Course\nTraditional New Orleans\nChicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo\n\n2nd Course\nButternut Squash Ravioli\nPrime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon\n\n3rd Course\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie\nPecan Pie\n\nI'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\n\nThe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written \"Emeril's Banana Cream Pie.\" I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\n\nI was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I've been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \n\nPersonally, I'm very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It's so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch. \n\nI'm very much looking forward to coming back.

I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).\n\nThe main dings are from:\n1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare.\n2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.\n\nThey do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.  \n\nThe main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).\n\nOverall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.

Although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.\n\nDelmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses I've been to. Their service is spectacular and on point every time I've been. They really do hire the best of the best. Attentive but not overbearing servers.  Delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. If you go, you must try their lobster bisque, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. Potato gratin is definitely one of their best sides also. And of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the STEAK!\n\nEmeril, you slightly let me down this time, but I still remember how good you've been to me the last times. I'll be back to let you redeem yourself.",

It had (and I quote from the menu) Fresh White Italian Truffles, Parmesan Reggiano, Vermont Butter and Local Chives. I can't wait to come back just to get this, but it was a special, so hopefully they will have it!\n\nThe staff was great too. Very helpful and not stuffy at all.

His best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.\n\nWe made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a very good pino noir, though I can't recall where it was from.\n\nWhen it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. Once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. Both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though I don't know I would go as far as saying there were \"friendly.\"\n\nWe all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. I got the lobster bisque, which I wasn't all that impressed with. I had better lobster bisque on cruise ship. It was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.\n\nWhen the entrees came, everything was fine. The steak was good, but I don't know that I would ever pay $50+ for it again. I asked for medium, and I got medium rare. Which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. So she had to send it back. The server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.\n\nI did like that they came with some sauces. The Bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. The sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. Our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. However, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.\n\nThe desserts were FANTASTIC. I had the creme brule, which was perfect. Soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. I would order that again in a heart beat. And we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. Definitely big enough for 2 people to share.\n\nOverall, 3 starts. Everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. When you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. And we just weren't.

He walked away before we could order drinks and we had to call him back.\n\nBut after the initial turbulence, everyone settled in and we had a good meal.  I started with the gumbo which was perfectly fine, but it lacked a little soul for me.  For my entree I ordered the burger, as mentioned.  I just wasn't in the mood for steak for lunch or any of the other entrees for that matter.  \n\nThe burger was freakin' awesome.  It didn't have any weird toppings, just the standard lettuce, tomato, mayo maybe, whatever.  But this thing was a MONSTER.  That burger must have been about 3/4 of a pound.  It stood about 8 inches high and was delivered with a steak knife plunged into it to keep it all put together.  There was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  This was a knife-and-forker all the way.  It was so much fun digging into that sexy hot beefy mama.  The fries were awesome too.  It's not often that I find a burger that I fall in love with but this is one that I will cherish forever.  5 star burger all the way.  Who needs a steak when you've got one of these babies.",

I think the big hit was the shrimp which takes about 12 hours to make that special bbq sauce. Then we were recommended to try to the bone in ribeye as far as steak. We were going there for steaks to start with but this was definitely a hit. Steak was perfectly cooked, dry aged (8 weeks i think) and we had a lovely potato gratin to complement that. I wasn't a big fan of the corn side dish we ordered though. The waiter also suggested a nice red wine to complement that. Service was top notch with 3-4 servers always around you which is very appreciable. If you are in a mood for steak, i think this is one of the best option in Vegas for sure.",

My bar of measure is Mr. B's in New Orleans French Quarter part of the Brennan family.  Short of flying to Paris to find a fair place to compete against Mr. B's grilled lamb chops, Delmonico's certainly gave Mr. B's a run for its money.\n\nI tried Delmonico's without looking at yelp first - in some countries I would be shot for this crime - and not knowing that Delmonico's even existed.  It was after a long day of work and simply being hungry, I walked into the first restaurant that was open without even looking at the menu.  When I was seated and handed the wine list, I knew I had found the right place, almost by divine inspiration.\n\nThe wine list was more like a wine book, only dedicating the last page to single glass selections.  The rest were bottles only.  This is where I figured out I was in a place worthy of my pallet.  They had 15 different vintages of Caymus Special Reserve.  Most fine dining places maybe have one or two at most.  Of course since the company was paying and no one to split a bottle, I could not in good conscious order a bottle.  I would have been hung by the accounting department.\n\nThe waiter gave the specials of the day and I of coursed b-lined for the lamb chops like a rabid dog.  When the dish arrived you could smell the fine attention to detail that the chef had prepared.  The Colorado rack of lamb with Roasted Cipollini Onions, Haricot Vert and Brandy Peppercorn Reduction staring back at me was love at first sight. \n\nI order my rack of lamb medium rare. Anything else would be blasphemous to the animal who sacrificed itself for my dining pleasure.  The lamb was tender and juicy all the way through.  The vegetables, especially the Cipollini onions soaked in the tender juices of the lamb melted in my mouth.  This was a meal that reminded me why it's so good to be alive.\n\nMy only regret and no fault to Delomico's is I broke and tried the bread pudding for desert.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured why not.  Being a bread pudding connoisseur and having such a spectacular experience with the lamb, I had high expectations.  I will be fair and say I was offered the key lime pie instead but I stayed true to course and ordered the bread pudding.\n\nWas it bad? No but it was certainly average for the area and if placed in New Orleans, it wouldn't even register on the map.  Delmonico's is marketed as \"creole\" restaurant and as such looses a star for the poor attempt on their bread pudding.  \n\nWill I be back? Absolutely without a doubt! Will I be ordering the bread pudding? No and if have a hankering for bread pudding after your meal at Delmonico's, mosey yourself on down to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  Order the spotted dog and you will be in bread pudding heaven.  With that said, Delmoico's is in my top three restaurants of all time in Las Vegas.  If you don't mind spending a pretty penny on dinner and you're a true fan of food, Delmonico's is hands down one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.",

I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \n\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\n\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\n\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \n\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there'll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.",

Being able to peer into the kitchen and watch the staff prep and cook while we eat alone already had a super cool factor to it!!!

Some of my favorites from the night were the truffle and parmesan chips, pork chops, steak, and dessert (esp the banana cream pie, and chocolate decadence cake, butter cake, and flan!).

The service was okay--we had a big party and they accommodated us, but I felt that since we were a younger crowd than normal, they didn't give the best service they could. The server didn't really smile and forgot one of our checks and so we had to wait for a while to get it backs. \nThe people in my party that didn't get steak enjoyed their dishes. If I go next time, I wouldn't order steak but yet this is a steakhouse..",

            "text" : "As a restaurant under Emeril Lagasse's name, I was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  Instead, I left very disapointed with the restaurant.  The only highlight was the signature BBQ shrimp appetizer.  The butternut squash raviolis with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  The shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  I don't know if I could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  So dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n\nThe truffle parmesan potato chips were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  Instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n\nThen there's the steak.  We ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  Both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  What creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  Well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  Even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n\nDon't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if I pay $50 for a steak, I expect flavor.  It felt like I was eating a $25 steak.   I almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  Even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n\nIn Vegas the only other steakhouse I've been to is N9ne at the Palms and I would recommend that over Delmonico's in a heartbeat.   I don't think I'll be going back.",

We walked in to this modern but simply decorated establishment on time and our party of 11 were immediately seated. Michael was our head server and he made sure we received water, a wine list and our menus.\n\nI had noticed that a summer trio for $65 was available so that is the angle I decided to take. I felt a little guilty that our employer was eating this tab so I wanted to be fair. I ordered the Mini Wedge, the Petite Rib-Eye and a Caramel Butter Cake a la mode. Most went this route although some selected the STRIP. You think Vegas had something to do with that?\n\nMy salad was good but I thought the Bleu Cheese on the plate was a bit understated. I do like Bleu Cheese with some POP. My Rib-Eye was called petite but it was still a plentiful portion. It was prepared PERFECTLY and the Chimichurri applied on top had the old taste buds doing somersaults.  \n\nThe dessert which is offered by itself was upgraded with a scoop of ice cream with Michael's recommendation. His idea was spot on. All in all, everyone enjoyed their FABULOUS meals. We laughed, conversed and immersed ourselves in each other. We definitely had a relaxing dinner. \n\nThe evening would not have been as grand without the service we received. Michael and his staff performed impeccably.

            "text" : "Went to Vegas with the husband to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and take that honeymoon that had been postponed for far too long.  One of the reasons we booked at the Venetian was to dine at Delmonico Steakhouse.\n\nWe originally made a reservation for lunch on Sunday but moved it to dinner as the husband was worried lunch service didn't offer all the varieties of steak.  Made the mistake of booking for 9 pm on Monday, August 20th.  The hotel was packed with a new rush of guests as was the restaurant.\n\nEnjoyed a drink in the bar before being seated and were then led to a small table where we were introduced to Josh, our primary server.  Josh informed us that we would have 3 servers that evening one of which would be a sommelier.  \n\nWe perused the wine list and then Lamont came over and asked \"if anyone had explained the menu\" to us - a jarring question in a fine dining establishment.  We decided to start with wine by the glass as we didn't want a full bottle at that point.  I asked Lamont about a blend on the list -- I inquired as to what was in the blend.  He asked me what I meant.  I clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  He rattled off one variety and then said \"and I think a Cabernet is in there\".  Lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  My husband asked Lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.  Lamont said no - they don't have garlic butter.  Really?!  This is an Emeril Lagasse restaurant!  He asked for a side of plain butter and we sent Lamont on his way.  \n\nA food runner, or possibly our third server (he never introduced himself), delivered a complimentary appetizer of tuna atop a crostini which I enjoyed but the husband did not.\n\nJosh came back with our wines.  We inquired as to whether Lamont was the sommelier that Josh had mentioned earlier and he affirmed that he was.  We expressed our surprise and disbelief yet Josh did not follow up with any inquiry as to why we asked the question.  At this point I had to talk my husband out of storming out of the restaurant.  Josh did not alert the floor manager of our question or our discontent.  It is unclear if this was because of poor training or due to the staff not being able to handle when the restaurant is full.\n\nOur salad with arugula, granny smith apples, prosciutto and champagne vinaigrette arrived and was very tasty.  We started to move past the negativity and then waited and waited for our entrees.  The husband ordered another glass of Malbec and asked for more bread, which never came.  The steaks were quite good but the extra butter was not delivered.  The twice baked potato was yummy and the side of mushrooms was divine.  \n\nThe espresso creme brulee and pecan pie desserts were very good and we appreciated the complimentary banana gelato with 'Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate but it still wasn't enough to make up for the fact that our servers' poor performance ruined an experience we looked forward to for months.  I would have given Delmonico Steakhouse one star due to the service but gave it two because of the food.  We expected much more.  I suggest you go somewhere else.\n\nFYI - Delmonico Steakhouse is a large restaurant that seats approximately 100 patrons.  The women's restroom has 2 stalls.",

I think the waiter said that the ribeye was a solid 19 ounce steak while the filet was 9 ounces so you can see the meat difference.\n\nOur server told us that they put a rub on the steak, the steak is carefully aged as well, and cook it with butter so it comes out with a nice char. Steaks were cooked perfectly and I like my steaks medium rare.\n\nWe also paired it with a nice Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon 2006.\n\nThe appetizers that we had were the truffle oil chips, creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The truffle and parmesan chips are a must to get...they're heavily!!! (couldn't taste the parmesan...even though I dislike cheese).\n\nIt's a must try steak house if you're ever in Las Vegas for a great meal!!!",

            "text" : "UPDATE - \n\nDelmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will. \n\nI'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - \n\nOne of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.\n\nDinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. \n\nAfter that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. \n\nWhen time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. \n\nThe pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing. \n\nAt this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. \n\nRough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).\n\nThe waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way. \n\nNot minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. \n\nThree different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit. \n\nWhen our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying \"here is your medium and rare filets\".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth. \n\n The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. \n\nAfter the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!\n\nI can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. \n\nWe passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. \n\nCan't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.",

            "text" : "Never get between a girl and her BONE-IN RIBEYE....NEVER!\n\nWhen deciding on restaurant for my friend's BIG 3-OH B-Day dinner, it was between CUT, N9NE, and Delmonico's. After YELPING and looking over all the menus, Delmonico's was the winner because it was conveniently located in The Venetian (we were staying at the Palazzo), decently priced compared to CUT, and had rave reviews about the bone-in ribeye. \n\nRESERVATIONS: \nMaking reservations was quick and simple. You can make reservations directly through the restaurant as opposed to The Wynn Restaurants where you have to call their restaurant hotline number and the wait is 20+ minutes.\n\nOn Friday, March 4, 2010, our party of 9 arrived around 7:15 PM. As we were escorted to our table, we couldn't help but notice the shape of our table. A round table was connected to a rectangular table which errr, resembled a male part. Don't know if it was intentional since I told them it was my male's friend's b-day party? Anyhow, it made for a good laugh. \n\nFOOD:\n*Lobster Bisque ($12.50): Rich, velvety smooth with generous chunks of sweet tender lobster equals YUMMYNESS! The only complaint is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Four of my friends also had the bisque and complained about the same thing.\n\n*16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52): One word...WOW! The bone-in ribeye, aged for 8 weeks was one the most flavorful steaks I've ever tasted! The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with nice charred crust and a pink center. You can tell that the marbling slowly melted and basted the meat during the cooking process producing a rich, amazingly tender, and savory cut of meat. Aside from the Kobe from Craftsteak, this is hands-down the best steak ever; and for the price point, you really can't go wrong. If there weren't anyone watching, I would have literally grabbed the ribeye by the bone and gone to town cave-man style--it was THAT good!\n\n*Creamed Spinach ($9): DELISH! The spinach was extremely fresh and maintained a vibrant green in the velvety and savory sauce. It was well-seasoned w/o being too salty and complemented the steak perfectly. \n\n*Creamed Corn Gratinee ($9): OMG good--it tasted like a mac & cheese made with corn. The creamed corn was sweet and tender and was topped with a panko breadcrumb crust which gave a nice crunch to the dish. It was an explosion of flavor and texture combos in your mouth...sweet, savory, buttery, and crunchy.\n\nSERVICE:\nImpeccable service, although a little pretentious at times. I guess you would expect nothing less from an upscale restaurant like Delmonico's. When it came down to serving our entrees, it was like a symphony as the waiters/waitresses served our dishes in-synch with one another to create a \"ta-daa\" moment.\n\nI would have given Delmonico's a 4.5 star rating, however, they allowed Freed's to deliver a b-day cake and didn't charge a slicing fee.\n\nAMBIANCE/DÉCOR: \nNormally steakhouses have a very \"dark\" ambiance. However, Delmonico's was the complete opposite. It was well-lit with Ivory walls and ceilings with accent cobblestone walls, crisp white linens and chestnut furniture created a very simple, yet elegant feel.\n\nI'm ALL about splurging when on vacation. Go big OR go home right? And, when you're in Vegas, you definitely have to go BIG--so, what are you waiting for? Go on and get your Bone-In Ribeye ON!",

Unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what I've had in the past at Delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  My husband and I shared a salad for an appetizer.  We let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  Unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.  \n\nI love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  It was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  My mom ordered seared ahi tuna which was served completely cold.  The outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  My husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  When the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.

My personal standout for the many sides we got was the potatoes au gratin...I'm still dreaming!!!  Our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said \"sssshhhhh.\"   Really???  If he was ruining something for other customers (which I'm sure he wasn't--others tables were toasting with us) than a manager should've come up and said something, not her.  I mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  She assured me it was not a problem.  We spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  Also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (I think even Cheesecake Factory does that?).  It just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. Unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  Four stars for food.  Not in a hurry to go back.  There's no \"sssshhhhh-ing in Vegas!\"",

We decided to have lunch here on our most recent Vegas excursion.  My dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  No biggie.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  Not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  We ordered the potato chips with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  I never thought of potato chips as a gourmet dish, but now I know better.  Excellent!\n\nMy sister and I split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  The waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  I've never had a waiter ask that before.  Pretty cool.  We also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice baked potato with white cheddar and bacon (OMG!).  So yummy!\n\nFor dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  Can you say holy banana goodness?  Another OMG moment!  In all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to Delmonico's.  ;)\n\nI would highly recommend dining at Delmonico's if you are in the neighborhood.

It's amazing.  \n\nThe boyfriend and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and he made reservations at Delmonico.  I was excited :) \n\nWhen we were being lead to our seats, we oohed and awwed about how beautiful the restaurant was.  The ceilings and structure reminded us of the Conciergerie in France.  Very pretty.  \n\nAnyway, we were seated and given a very extensive wine list--some wines upward of $3000.  We opted for a glass of wine.  We opened the menu and no more than 5 minutes later, we knew exactly what we were going to order--scallops and gnocchi in basil butter sauce, lobster bisque, and two bone in ny strips cooked medium rare.  No sides--we wanted the beef.  \n\nAbout 10 minutes after we ordered, the waiter brought out a complimentary amuse-bouche.  Two puff pastries with bleu cheese mousse and walnuts.  They wanted to wish us a happy anniversary! How wonderful is that?  My bf was very surprised--when he had booked the reservation they asked him if it was for a special occassion.  He was very surprised they did something about it.  Well, it was delicious.  Now we were even more enthusiastic about the food.\n\nThe lobster bisque came next, and it was fantastic.  Creamy and perfectly seasoned.  The scallops (2 huge scallops to be exact) came next and were wonderful.  Perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside.  \n\nAnd the steak...oh boy.  It's huge!  It came out seared on the outside with a dollop of herbed butter.  I couldn't wait to get at it. It was perfectly red on the inside.  This was hands down the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was seared so perfectly, that the fat around the edges of the steak were crispy (yes, I actually a good helping of the fat. It's better than butter!)  The food was amazing and we ate as much as we could--leaving behind almost nothing at all.  \n\nStill, we wanted dessert.  Pecan pie a la mode with caramel sauce. Fanfreakingtastic!!!  Delicious! The waiter told us it was the best pecan pie he had had in his life, and I concur.  Yummy! \n\nI only have high praises for this place.  Aside from the food, the staff was attentive and gracious.  We can't wait to go back--even if the $200 bill hurt a bit.",

His recommendations just simply rocked. The ambiance was spacious, open, modern and comfortably cozy - the dining area is huge and perfect for large group dinners. We stayed at the Palazzo so it was a convenient location to head to since its in the heart of the Venetian. \n\nNow here are the juicy deets on the food: \n1. Tomato Bisque soup with a dollop of cream: OH MY GOODNESS. So creamy and absolutely delicious\n2. Filet of beef medallions: The juiciest and most tender pieces of beef you'll ever find topped with mushrooms & bread crumbs, apple bacon, parmesan cheese and a special home made sauce *insert tears of happiness* \n3. Delmonico's prime hamburger: Oh my oh my. Served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese and bacon and accompanied by a bed of fries... this burger is unlike your average joe one. It's hearty, juicy, tender and foodgasmic. Do yourselves a major favor and include this as one of your entrees. \n4. Emeril's banana cream pie: After all of the steak and appetizers, my stomach was literally about to burst from fullness. However, at the taste of this pie, I was somehow able to stretch my pants to new heights and devour the whole pie. Thank goodness my bf and I ordered our own desserts because he just wouldn't have gotten any otherwise. \n5. The pinot noir I ordered was the perfect complement to all of the above, taking my palette to new extremes. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name, but I do remember that it was from Sonoma and I ordered it by the glass. \n\nWe also had the lobster bisque and the BBQ shrimp as appetizers. While they were phenomenal as well, they were a mere 5 stars in comparison to the 6-7 star dishes above. So basically, you can't lose by ordering anything at Delmonico's. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!",

Well, on my recent trip to the USA, I had Yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!\n\nVegas Elite Dennis T was my lunch companion when I was in town. Not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but I was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review\n\nDennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n\nI had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico\n\nI instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n\nThe restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n\nI had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n\nDennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad\n\nIt may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n\nDennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n\nIn an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this\n\nDennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the Strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights\n\nA friendship sealed. A celebrity chef ticked off. Lobster sliders consumed. A most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!",

Where's the flavor Emeri?!? \nMy steak was ordered medium - my steak came out well done and tough. There were no add ons to compliment the steak, perhaps a dry rub, a sauce maybe? I asked for lemon to zest my steak, considering I still had every intention of eating it  (Yes, hunger is real when you're in Vegas on the weekend).. but what disappointed me the most were the cocktail lemon wedges which I received from our server.. \nIt was more of an, \"Are you kidding me? Delmonico cannot afford to add simple cheesecloth, or a gauze socks around half lemons and here I am cashing out 300 bucks!?\"\n\nI try my best to give each business the best reflection possible, but in all fairness Delmonico greatly lagged.

The octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  The foie gras was rich.  I followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\nThe disappointment occurred during the main course.  Three of the people in our party ordered the filet mignon.  Two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  I had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. My filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. I suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    Additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  There was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n\nFor a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, I hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. I can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.

We also got the buttered broccoli and potatoes augrautin. \n It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out and were given 2 pieces of bread which were light and tasty. The servers waiting our table did an excellent job of keeping our water topped off. And when our food was ready a small army of servers marched up and placed everything almost simultaneously. They all were impeccably dressed and very attentive and polite. \n Well, now to the really disappointing part which is also the most important. The food. I'm a foodie. And in particular a steak connoisseur. This was in my opinion the worst dry aged steak I've ever had. Not even to mention at this price point. I've had better steaks at any number of chain restaurants. It came drenched in a marinade and was full of gristle. I honestly believe we were served a cheap choice or select cut instead of dry aged prime for which we paid. The sides were OK. But the steaks were bad. And when shelling out over $150 for it needs to be an amazing meal. Do I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. And the only reason I didn't make a scene over the poor quality of our steaks was I was try desperately to salvage our special dinner. \n Emiril, step up the quality control!",

I don't know how they do it but the steaks always have this crispy, char on the outside but have a good juicy center with lots of flavor.\n\nWe shared the grits, corn and mushrooms as sides and they were tasty good.\n\nLike I said, this is a special occasion place and Delmonico has yet to disappoint. \n\nThanks Emeril for always making my trip to Vegas!",

Perfection. I found everything to be just as I ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. We got the Bacon-Cheddar Polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which I didn't try) and also, the creamed spinach.

the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\n\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie's Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city's best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\n\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril's famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.",

We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \n\nBBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \n\nMy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and I can't remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn't come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \n\nWe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \n\nFor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It's pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.",

It pains me to admit this, but I stepped foot in the Venetian during my most recent Vegas trip :(  Just to clarify, this was NOT by choice, but by circumstance. Me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. Long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us. \n\nWith that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. It was surprisingly really good.  \n\n**APPETIZERS: I had the French Onion Soup and my boyfriend had a salad. The appetizers were so-so. We definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.\n\n**ENTREES: My boyfriend and I each ordered the Bone in Ribeye. Had we known how HUGE they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. I was surprised at how good my steak was. I wanted to pull a \"Fred Flinstone\" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  My steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. Even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks. \n\n**SIDES: We had the Creamed Corn Gratin & Potato Gratin. Both of which were creamy and delicious.  \n\nThe service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. I'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the Venetian -_-",

So of course this is what I decided on ordering, and so did he.  Which I was a little bummed because I was hoping he would order something different so we can share.  Our dish was served in a large bowl, and it was a sampling of pork, beef and chicken that was served over garlic mash potatoes.   We also ordered the caesar salad prepared table side.  This was very impressive and of course delicious.\n\nFor desert I chose the banana cream pie and he chose the double chocolate fudge cake.  They were both superb, which I wasn't expecting any less.\n\nThe service is impeccable.  I have never been to a restaurant this nice and I felt like a queen for the time that we were there.

Therefore, it was a logical imperative that we check out Delmonico Steakhouse and its vaunted whiskey collection.  We got there around 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was largely empty as the restaurant was nearing the end of its service for the night.  As a side mission, we wanted to also check out the much-mentioned \"secret\" menu of whiskey-based cocktails created and crafted by Delmonico's lead barman, Max Solano.  Max possesses encyclopedic knowledge of whiskey and is personable and passionate about what he does and if he isn't busy, is very willing to impart some of his knowledge discussing the finer points of whiskey and his whiskey program.  As the curator of Delmonico's whiskey collection, he's assembled the most comprehensive lineup of whiskeys I've ever seen to include hundreds of ultra high quality, hard to find, or never heard of before brands from around the world.  As a personal aside, did they have Pappy Van Winkle?  Yes, of course,...the ENTIRE frickin' Pappy product line and it was on the shelf, not out of stock like so many other places that have it listed on their menu!  I was so tempted to get the Pappy whiskey flight, but on this visit, I was even more intrigued by the secret menu of cocktails.  \n\nDelmonico has a standard (but very intriguing looking) cocktail menu consisting of classics and originals that all of the bartenders can prepare.  However, only Max knows how to craft the secret menu cocktails.  I had the Don's Orders made with Templeton Rye and the Smoked Bluff made with Glenmorangie 12 yr. and both were complex, boozy with subtle sweetness, yet completely balanced.  Simply put, Max's secret menu cocktails were hands down the best treatment of whiskey in a cocktail form that I've yet consumed.  If you love whiskey, then the Delmonico Steakhouse is a must!

All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.",

It was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. Odd.\n\nWe both had a filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not worth $50. It came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. Without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n\nWe ordered a side of double baked potatoes. That was the best part of the meal.\n\nWe each ordered a dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little cream. It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n\nService was very nice.

            "text" : "For me to give this place 3 stars takes complete honesty from me and also shows my disappointment.  I wanted so much to love this place, to crown it, (it wasn't what I thought it was!), to walk out wholly satisfied in the knowledge that I will not have a better steak.  Dining here was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of this Vegas trip, \"remember the time we ate at Delmonico's...\" type thing.  The 3 stars is my confession to myself, this place was not worth the price.\n\nI'm no lover of Cajun food, or spices or anything, and the only thing I know about Emeril is he says \"BAM!\" a lot and the character Elzar on Futurama is a direct parody of him.  I've got no urge to try any more of his food though.  We ate here the evening of the Final Four, had an early reservation and was seated promptly in a fairly quiet room.  Good corner location where we could look out at everything around us but not have people walk by us.  The decor was not of any note... \n\nWe started with the cocktail shrimp with crackers... very odd.  I've been eating a lot of shrimp lately, and there was nothing special about these.  The sauce was a bit spicier than others, so decent.  I pushed my girlfriend to try the kobe...  while I stuck with my old standby of NY.  The bread was nothing special as well.\n\nMy sides were pretty average... I enjoyed my girlfriend's fried scallops though.  The vegetables and potatoes are just complements to the meal though.  The kobe steak came all sliced up and ready to go... It wasn't the mind blowing experience with kobe that I hoped it would be.  I could see the disappointment on my gf's face as she chewed on it.  On the plus side, the kobe sirloin meal came with the sides so thats a few bucks saved.  And sadly, thats the plus side of it.  \n\nMy steak was of a fairly average size, maybe an inch thick, bone-in and perhaps 16 ounces.  I ordered it medium... which the waiter confirmed would be pink throughout.  I waver between medium-rare and medium.. usually if a steak is bone-in I go medium.  Unfortunately, my steak was overcooked.  It got to that bastard style known as medium-well.  I kept hoping as I got closer to the bone it would pinken up, but no such luck.  I ate it happily as it was still a good steak, but I just couldn't shake the disappointment.  The seasoning used on it was decent and had some spice to it but no charm to it.  Part way through my meal I attempted to knife-lift a portion for the gf to try, and wound up dropping it on the table cloth leaving a huge outline of meat.  We laughed about it and both expected our waiter to say something, anything about it as he brushed it with the crumb brush.  Sigh, no such warmth here.  Service was efficient and not quite friendly.  I guess high end steakhouses cater to clients that would rather not have their imperfections pointed out.  One look at me would suggest I'm not the typical client, but no joke came from either our waiter or the assistant waiter.  \n\nAfter we perused the desert menu, I settled on the banana cream pie.  This was the best banana cream pie I've ever had.  It was beautifully presented, had fresh bananas, and was not too sweet.  This was the favorite part of the meal for me.  I doubt I'll ever have a better banana cream pite,  but I'll keep looking.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal but not worth the price.  Meal was ~$200 for 2, no drinks, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I doubt I'll ever go back on my own wallet.",

We started off with a few drinks.\n\nFried Soft-Shell Crab:\nAn appetizer with poached egg, frisee salad and lemon truffle vinaigrette. Lightly breaded and fried. Not greasy, not fatty and the shell was definitely soft. The citrusy salad compliments the dish. One of the best soft-shell crab versions I've had. We got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5\n\nFilet Mignon:\nSince I'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what I normally get. Some people may find it boring but I like my steak simple and lean. Very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. This piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5\n\nChateaubriand:\nThe second most tender and lean cut of meat. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5\n\nBone-In Ribeye:\nDry-aged prime with butter on top. Superb! 4/5\n\nFoie Gras:\nThis was a side item. Perfectly seared and mildly sweet. You don't really need to do much to make foie gras taste good. KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5\n\nMushrooms with Garlic:\nThis side was really good. I love mushrooms and garlic. The mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. They were deliciously garlicky. 5/5\n\nGrits:\nThis has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. I wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5\n\nCreme Brulee:\nI've been feeling tired of this dessert. I didn't find joy in eating this. Plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5\n\nDelmonico Coquetel:\nGin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. Their signature cocktail...but why? Our server was right, I should've not wasted my time on this. It was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. I took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5\n\nA Tale of Two Cities:\nCherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. This was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5\n\nAnother drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. Since I'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. We got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. Service was good.

Delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. I liked the simplicity. \n\nOur waiter and his team were very attentive. Water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. They were all very professional. \n\nThe meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. I began my meal with the Wilted Spinach and Frisee salad. It was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. The bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. The candied bacon was amazing. They perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. All of the flavors worked so well together. \n\nIt was hard to order something other than steak, but it was Thanksgiving so I had to have my traditional dinner. The Thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. The turkey was very moist and flavorful. The plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. Under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. A delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. There was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n\nMy husband and I split a Twice Baked Potato because you have to have potatoes on Thanksgiving. I'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. The potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n\nFor dessert I had the Pecan Pie and my husband had the Thanksgiving dessert special. My Pecan Pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. The crust was buttery and flaky. I don't like crust usually, but this was very good. There was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. My husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. This kind of fell flat. Nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n\nI can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items.",

I ordered the ribeye to share along with the best lobster bisque you will ever have. Also the truffle potato chips are to die for. The restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. I've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the Venetian, and I have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. The steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.\n\nSince this is a popular restaurant, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance.

We were a party of 6 and truth be told we were running on fumes from the prior evenings festivities (how strange...in vegas??) so this review is based on our less than average appetites. Although we did order a lot more than we could manage to eat.\n\nTheir most popular steak is probably the bone in rib-eye and it's a whopping 16 ounces (without bone)...quite hefty and although the steak was cooked to perfection it was definitely under seasoned. It also seemed mine had a bit more fat than usual which is as we know is where all the flavour is but it seemed perhaps a bit too much. All the sides were awesome and their meant to be shared family style... definitely try the garlic mushrooms!\n\nService was top notch...not in your face but always there making sure your wine is topped off and full of suggestions when you need.\n\nI've been to STK in Vegas and if you're looking for the more swank place you might want to hit that up but for a more authentic steakhouse experience I'd definitely recommend Delmonico...",

The manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  The wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.\n\nWe had the truffle & parmesan potato chips, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips.\nFor our main courses, I ordered the filet mignon.  My date ordered the bone in ribeye with foie gras.  My steak was arguable the best steak I've ever had.  It was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  I had a bite of the ribeye with foie gras, which was just savory overload.\nFor dinner, we received a complimentary \"Happy Birthday\" sorbet with a candle in it.\n\nI had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.

My husband ordered the double-cut pork chop, the size of a dinosaur. It was supposed to be medium, but was charred and a bit over done. I ordered the sea bass, but asked the chef to prepare it like the snapper special. It was thin, overly salted, and overall just not good. I am not a fan of al dente rice. I'm sure the chef prepares entrees a certain way for a reason, this just missed the mark in so many ways for me, when I had such high expectations. The head server promptly replaced my meal with a medium rare filet, in about 60 seconds. The steak looked dry, besides the pat of butter atop, the plate was hot, making me think it had been under the food warmer for some time. There was a crusted char on the exterior and Cajun seasoning, which again in my opinion was too much, and too salty. I want to taste the steak at a steakhouse, not cover it.

The pie isn't as creamy as the yummy banana cream pie from Jongewaard's, but I think that may be because the banana to pudding ratio favors the bananas.

The Tuna and salmon both were very tasty but the portion was rather small.  For $18, I would expect a little bit more.  Now on to the reason why we dined here....my steak came out and it looked giant.  The overall taste of the meat was only decent at best.  I was really expecting a more flavorful piece of meat.  Maybe they forgot to season it or just didn't put enough of emeril's spice?  I could tell though the meat quality was very, very good.  They advertise wet-age steaks, but I much prefer dry-aged steaks.  Too bad my steak was only just okay and for $52 I didn't feel ripped off but more disappointed.

The steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. No steak is complete without a side of creamed spinach, which was done well. All sides are portioned to be shared. Despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in NY strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.",

I must say, service was stellar. Staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n\nStarting off with some bread and aperitif, I chose a glass of Blue label Chimay as my poison. Ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. For appetizers, I had their OYSTER ROCKEFELLER. This baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as I hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. I can't complain. \n\nNext came the main show, BONE-IN RIBEYE which my man and I split. Split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. No fee for split plate, thank you. I like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as I expected it to be. A dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. It had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from Chef Emeril Lagasse's kitchen. Did it taste bad? No, not at all. I just think that being in Vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow Yelpers. \n\nMy side of choice was the CREAMED SPINACH. Now we're talking! It tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. Finally, Chef Emeril's true colors are coming out. And on a sweet note, we ended the evening with EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. Can I say, WOW!? I will have to say this was the best banana cream pie I've had to date. Hats off to you, Chef! This my friends, earned Delmonico Steakhouse the 4 stars I'm giving them. \n\nWould I come back? Sure! I'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. But more importantly, I shall not forget EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. It's to die for!",

For our personal experience, maybe 3.5 stars, but I'd go back, as I think some things were specific to our visit and I think the restaurant can do better. \n\nJim G. and I stopped in at the bar for a spot of lunch. The bartender was often friendly, but sometimes seemed a bit confused or overwhelmed.  Turned out, he was new. Some of that is forgivable, but it wasn't busy at the bar, so some of it suggests that he's maybe not the best bartender in general.  Perhaps he was having an off day.  \n\nThe cocktails were interesting and well-crafted but, in some cases (like the Bronte Sisters), the focus seemed so much on presentation that the actual drink part of the drink was missing. The full copper mug of crushed ice left me with a tiny, tiny drink for $16. The wine list is incredibly extensive and led me to a surprising error.  The way it's printed, it sometimes leads the eye to the wrong price, as the name of the wine and the price don't visually seem to be on the same line.  The wine we ordered was great, as I knew it would be, but it was not at the great price I thought it was. Nice surprise for us on the bill when it was 2.5x more! Technically, not their fault, but it feels like it wasn't an accident on their part. It was lunch; not like I already had been drinking!\n\nOnion soup was awesome! Get some, for real! Very dark roux, super flavorful cheese. We shared a steak which was not quite the size our bartender told us it would be (ounces aren't on the menu) but was prepared nicely. The steaks (all except Wagyu) are prepared cajun style, so expect a different flavor profile than your traditional steak. \n\nGood food, but the bar needs more energy (maybe a bit of music?) and a bit of tweaking with the bartender.

Hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nSides - We ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   The corn was very good.  It had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  The asparagus was pretty plain.  I had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\nDessert - We ordered the banana cream pie.

It was clean and dimly light like most steak places. The waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. I got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. But it didnt bother me too much.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was very impressed. The steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The side dishes were just ok. We ordered broccoli, creamed spinach, and fingerling potatoes. I wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. Not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n\nWe also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. I didnt know much about it, the winery was called Mastery and it was a red wine. My bro ordered it not me and it was really good! It was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n\nThis is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!",

A juicy skirt steak is topped with loads of roasted mushrooms, onions, wilted spinach and a pungent horseradish mayo on a warm ciabatta roll with a side of crispy truffle fries.  A great deal for under $20.\n\nDinner brings out the best.  For starters its hard to pass on the truffle parm potato chips (you weren't expecting that huh).  Crispy, earthy, just good eats and so perfect with any cocktail or wine.  The roasted heirloom tomato soup with  grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, creamy and acidic, comforting goodness.\n\nThe steaks are all great quality USDA prime.  Well trimmed and dry aged on site.  Unfortunately, the selection of cuts is limited.   The bone in strip, dense beefy goodness and stands up well to the Creole seasoning (used on all their steaks).  Dry aged steak purist will balk at its use as it destroys the umame goodness.  The bone in rib is more tender and makes the perfect base for \"Oscar\" style prep (topped with a generous heaping of jumbo lump crab meat, asparagus, and a very rich and tangy béarnaise that blends perfectly with the creole seasoning). Win!\n\nIt's not all about the steaks.  The apple smoked kurobuta ham chop with grits and cider reduction is outstanding.  Pure simplicity.  Natural, tender ham packing  deep \"hammy\" flavor whose richness and saltiness is balanced perfectly by the acidity and sweetness of hard cider reduction.  Holiday ham on steroids!\n\nFriendly and efficient service.\n\nVery good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.\n\nBAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! (Four stars; yeah I couldn't resist).",

For my entree I had a bone-in ribeye w/ foie gras ($72 - $52 for the steak & $20 for the foie gras), my friend had the regular ribeye ($48), and on the side we had haricot vert almondine ($11) & fingerling potatoes ($12).  \n\nThe gnocchi was very good.  It had a nice crisp and the truffles accented the taste of the potatoes in the gnocchi very well:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the steak was not very good.  It was fatty, chewy in some spots and not that flavorful.  The waiter stated that Delmonico's has the best steaks in town.  Sorry, but I have had better steaks at STK and T-Bonz in Summerlin:  2 Stars.  The foie gras was OK.  It was nice to see it on the menu because you can't find it in CA.  However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.\n\nTo accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.\n\nThe ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.\n\nI will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.  The steak was lousy, the bathroom is lame and the service sucked for an establishment of this caliber.  Word to Emeril:  You need to work on this restaurant - BAM!!!",

This is my first Emeril's experience and it was a good one. \n\nDisclaimer: A fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it! \n\nI was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. The appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp with biscuit. The shrimp were easily the most tasty that I've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). I wish I had 2 or even three. The biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), It actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.\n\nFor my entree I had the filet mignon ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. I order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. In this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. This was easily the best steak I've ever had - and I'm a red meat fan. \n\nService was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and I was simply too full to try dessert. The rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The highlight of the evening may have been seeing Larry Flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. Apparently he's a regular.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by Emeril's Delmonico. You WON'T be disappointed.",

Well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n\nThis was the third Emeril restaurant that I've eaten at.  I used to live in New Orleans and ate at his first restaurant, Emeril's, and his casual outpost, NOLA, several times.  The food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n\nDelmonico's continues that tradition.  The service is excellent.  At times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  Food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  And the decor is so understated and clean.  It really is a nice change from all of the typical Vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n\nBecause my girlfriend was so eager to try Emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (New Orleans style) and shrimp cocktail with remoulade sauce.  The lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  However, it wasn't on the menu and I really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  The waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the shrimp cocktail.  To drink, she ordered a glass of Loosen Bros.  \"Dr. L Estate\" Riesling and I ordered a glass of Laurent Perrier NV Champagne. \n\nThe Riesling was recommended by the Asst. Sommelier.  The waiter initially recommended an Australian white blend.  But to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  When I commented to the Sommelier that I thought the Australian white had Viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  As we talked more, he said the Riesling was a \"perfect match\" for the barbecued shrimp.  You know what?  It was.  My girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the Riesling with each bite.  She even raved - it was a perfect match.  And she also loved the remoulade.  The barbecued shrimp were cooked well, I noticed one of the shrimp I had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  The shrimp cocktail was great.  Cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  They were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n\nFrom there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY PERFECTLY MED-RARE TO MED.  It wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  The twice baked potato with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  The asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  We shared a half bottle of 2003 Pine Ridge Crimson Creek Merlot which was a good match for the steak.  It had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n\nDessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  Both were excellent.  The banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  She ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), I ordered a glass of 2003 Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n\nWas it inexpensive? Of course not.  It was quite expensive.  But for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than Gallagher's and probably the second best only to Bouchon of the restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas) and the best service I've had in Vegas (yes, better than Bouchon), it was worth it.  \n\nWhy 5 stars?  Because everything went right.  Was the service perfect? Almost.  Was the food perfect?  Almost.  Were the drinks perfect?  Almost.  Adding that all together with the right person I wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (Although I didn't ever finish my French Laundry review, that place IS nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  It is still to this day, the best eating experience I have ever had and I've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n\nNow if I could only remember the name of the Asst. Sommelier, I would give him a shout out here.  \n\nI am once again a fan of Emeril.  But please, no \"BAM.\"",

Even the sides that my fiance and I split: smashed potatos, and asparagus-- were top notch. It's too bad that such an awesome culinary experience had to be ruined by everything else.\n\nFirst off: the decor. VERY spare, with high ceilings. Kind of felt like I was eating in a fancied up gymnasium. The dining room was dark but the sparse spot lighting was harsh, taking away any sort of mellow ambiance they hoped to achieve.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we were seated, a party of 7 very loud middle aged men came into the restaurant and sat at the table next to us. My fiance and I only ordered salad and dinner, and soda to drink since we don't pay for booze in Vegas. ;) This OTHER table was ordering bottles of wine and appetizers out the wazoo, and the waitstaff took the cue to ignore us and focus on the table that certainly ensured a bigger tip.\n\nThis was a HUGE turnoff. We are very lowkey customers by nature -- no substitutions, no special requests -- I waited tables during my college years so I know what it's like to be on the other side of things. But to sit there for 10 minutes with empty plates and glasses in front of us while 4 or so staffmembers fell over each other at the adjacent table uncorking bottles, getting out appetizers... it was unacceptable. It made us feel like intruders with our lowly $130 bill.\n\nPLUS, they charged us for soda refills? at $2.00 a pop. If I'm paying $50 for a steak, don't charge me for a stupid refill of Diet Coke.\n\nThe meal itself was awesome, but with so many other options in Vegas to choose from, we probably won't be going back. I was happier with the French Toast Slam I had at Denny's earlier in the day: No pretension, my waiter didn't suck, and I didn't get charged for a refill.",

Once she digged in, she couldn't keep her knife off it. It was so juicy and delicious! I was actually eying her rib-eye the whole time. We actually swapped our dishes half way.

We took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. Not enough time to rate the cocktail service. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app. \n\nOn to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n\nThe fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish. \n\nDue to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe... \n\nThe service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \"Emerel's Blend\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.",

            "text" : "Delmonico's is an institution - but it's by no means a \"5-Star\" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn't the founder of the original Delmonico's of New Orleans.\n\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico's serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who've been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \"Commander's Palace\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \"Delmonico's\".    And that's a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten was at the New Orleans' Delmonico's... not the Vegas location.\n\nGOOD NEWS:  IT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\nBut I don't think you'll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it's all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\n\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\nHere's the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\n1) FLAVOR\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico's and I think Charlie Palmer's outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina's StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It's probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \n2) SERVICE\nIf you're looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it's hard to beat Delmonico's.  That's something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer's probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there's rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I've consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\n3) DÉCOR\nIt's darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I've noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I'm not sure this is really a big point.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\nDelmonico's, while it's lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\n\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\n\n-----------------\nINSIDER'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You'll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico's in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I've pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on 'immediate seating' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu's really has no such seating other than \"next table available\")",

The lobster bisque was just ok - I have had better in my town of 150,000 and it usually has sherry in it - not there.  There were nice chunks of lobster in it though.  We expected more from an Emeril restaurant and really didn't feel that it had a Louisiana flair, although apparently it specializes in steaks.

Nevertheless, I wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  After consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetian.\n\nFirst, I was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time I booked the trip).  It was so easy I would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  Second, because Mr. Vivi and I were killing it at the Blackjack table at the Mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  I apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  Note:  I don't know if this would fly on a busy Fri or Sat night.\n\nTo say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  We had our main server, I think his name was Eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned Blackjack table so his name could have been Bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  We also had two other people who were assisting Eric with the service who were great as well.  Eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  Our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.  \n\nI had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, I had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  We opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the Parmesan potato chips) and went straight to the Cesar salad served table side for two.  If you love Cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  They freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  When Eric was finished with my plate I could have clapped I was so happy...in fact I think I did. \n\nNext, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice baked potato.  Can I say I am in heaven??  This is why I could never be a vegetarian.  The meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  So tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  The asparagus and twice baked potato were both good, but I would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.  \n\nI knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  From start to finish the entire experience made me forget I left a table we were up 500 dollars.  \"Ah yeah babe,\" this place is that good and I will be back the next time I visit.",

Although the first sip of the soup seemed a little salty, the flavor is very good, strong and savory. It is one of my favorite dishes here. \n\nMy husband ordered the beef carpaccio arugula salad because the salad we normally order from here is no longer on the menu. We were not sure what to order but after we tasted the salad we loved it. It is a very large salad which almost felt like a meal and it has a very clean balanced savory taste.  My husband says that this was one of his favorite salads; me on the other hand I still like the old salad I used to older here.  maybe I'm just more old-school and like my salad plain with arugula, spinach, tomatoes and good cheese. \n\nWe ordered two entrées. One was the salmon entrée which was insanely divine. It is served with a big piece of salmon fillet with grilled sweet corn and crab pieces which complimented the salmon impeccably. Both my husband and I love this dish and we both indicated that we will be ordering this again in the future when we come back here. In fact we may each order one of this salmon dish. That is how much we love this dish. It is very delicious. Any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.\n\nThe other entrée that we ordered was the lobster sliders. I did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. I personally do not like cold sandwiches and also I only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. The lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it. Although they did not skimp on the lobster meat and they do give you a lot of big chunks of lobster meat with the sliders, the taste was not to my personal liking.

I am skeptical of the USDA Prime rating for this steak -- it was nowhere near as high quality as other Prime steaks I've had.  Creamed spinach was oddly tough and chewy -- I don't even know how that is possible but it was.\n\nOn the plus side, the lighting is effective and the whisky and bourbon selection is great.\n\nService felt very scripted and impersonal.\n\nI can't believe the reputation this place has.  I guess it is Vegas, and when people pay top dollar they put on their rose tinted glasses and fail to see that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nIf it was not for the price and reputation, i would say it was a decent meal.

            "text" : "The steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. The decor was very clean and contemporary. The hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nThe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared The beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. The booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\nI took my seat and I was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. I decided to go with their Filet Mignon and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. The chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. Classic jumbo shrimp cocktail, Parmesan truffle chips, classic Caesar salad, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nThe classic jumbo shrimp cocktail with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as I expected. The shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. The sauce was like eating a handful of Wasabi.\n\n The extremely addicting truffle Parmesan chips were EXCELLENT and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. The chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved Parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nThe classic Caesar salad had much to desire. The way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. It was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing Caesar dressing. I don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic Caesar salad just to be different. Don't mess with a good thing!\n\nThe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. The mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. The waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. The plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. Not a good sign of service. \n\nThe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the Filet was ammmmazing. The steak knife cut through the Filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some New Orleans style spices. I truly enjoyed the Filet till the very last bite. One thing I do have to mention is the dessert. I would highly recommend the famous Emeril's banana cake. This thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. I could not even describe it in words if I even tried so I won't! So you will have to try it for yourself. \n\nOverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best I have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. My favorite parts were the Filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the truffle chips, mmm! delicious! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. I was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. That can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience I'd say that was definitely worth it! Many thanks for reading. Till next time.",

Drinks were good and packed a punch.  We started with Barbecue Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  Barbecue shrimp was the same as at Emeril's other restaurants.  Delicious.  I only wish you got more then 4 shrimp and 1 tiny biscuit.  The fried green tomatoes were one of the nights specials.  They were topped with lump crap and fried light and crisp.  For our Entrees I got Emeril's Barbecue Salmon, he got Bone In Ribeye.  We chose Twiced Baked Potato and Grits for our sides.  Salmon and steak were both wonderful and cooked perfectly.  The sides were creamy and rich, but very similar in flavor.  We loved them both but probably should have order something with more variety.  We finished with Banana Cream Pie and Caramel Butter Cake for dessert.  The Banana Cream Pie is Emeril's signature dessert that is served in all his restaurants.  Hubby loves it and it's a must order for us.  It was our first time ordering the Caramel Butter Cake and it didn't disappoint.  It was served warm and covered in gooey caramel.  Service started off slow, but got better as the meal went on.  We had incorrect charges on our bill that were quickly corrected when we brought it to our servers attention.",

This time we got the corn it is creamy with a tiny kick of chili peppers and a crunch on top of Panko crumbs. The corn is absolutely delicious! The asparagus is just plain steamed asparagus but it is good too. I have had the spinach, the potatoes, the mushrooms, and the grits in the past, all great but this corn was soooo very good. The popovers are served just after drink orders but they are not replenished or served in a basket. Your back up server will just make one round so they are served fresh and warm. If you want more you will have to ask. \nThis time we were not served a complimentary mini appetizer as we had always been served in the past years. We did see other tables served this though. Perhaps because we delayed our ordering due to waiting on drinks and our conversation time. \nDessert was the pecan pie. This pecan pie is not the icky sweet oozy gooey pie that I am used to. This one is more tart like, not so sweet or gooey st all. The crust is more cookie like. It was good but I would probably not get this again.

We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.",

But when it comes to food, I think to myself, \"Is it really worth the cost to put something in only to have it come out?\" \n\nIn this case, \"Yes!\" Okay... Sort of... \n\nI ordered the boneless Ribeye and a side of broccoli. Ribeye was good - just enough flavor and not too salty. Being the carnivore that I am, I was shocked that I really enjoyed the broccoli too. It was as perfect as steamed vegetables could get. It was bright green from top to bottom and crispy, not mushy. \n\nMy sister had pasta with shrimp. I must say, though there was shrimp on her plate, they were not \"shrimp\" at all! They were huge!! Seriously, Delmonico must get their produce, seafood and meat from \"Food Heaven R Us\" or something. \n\nAlthough the food was good, I would say the service is what gives Delmonico 4-stars. Again, I'm not a frequent fine diner. So, to have my water glass filled up every time it gets low to having another (delicious) roll magically appear on my plate just as I suck in the last mouthful is fantastic! I'd even go so far as to say they'd probably spray the air around me with something fragrant once the broccoli hit you know where. \n\nNow I can see why it's worth it to pay at least $50 for dinner.

I think I could have done it without the olives - I let the husband order this one.  I would have picked something different.  \n\nSalad: It was the special - arugula, figs, and mousse foie gras\nThe husband was a bit iffy, but because I let him pick the appetizer, he couldn't say much.  Holy crap, that was a yummy fricken salad even the husband liked it!!  I would so order that again.\n\nMain Courses:\nhusband - bone-in ribeye. \nme - bone-in new york steak.\nBOTH were yummy!  They were both cooked to order.  The only thing we didn't like about it was the butter that came on top of both of them.  We didn't think it was neccessary.     \n\nSide dish:\nFingerling potatoes with halves garlic.  \nThis was a waste.  We didn't really eat any of them because they were way too salty.  I love me some salt too, but it was just way too much for heart to handle.  We should have asked for something different, but I didn't want to wait.  We did have a show to catch.\n\nThumbs up:\nThey did recognize our anniversary and gave us a complimentary dish before our salad came out.  I forgot what it was, but it consisted of a chip of some sort, with a slice of beef on top.  It tasted it like it had ginger, soy, and some more stuff and also sesame seeds.  It was really good!

We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, \"Yes\".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.

I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.

I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just \"OK\". My breakdown of each dish is this:\n\nThe Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).\n\nAppetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.\n\nCreamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.\n\nTwice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.\n\nRibeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Béarnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Béarnaise WAS THE BOMB!\n\nSmoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty. \n\nPecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.\n\nAs previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the \"upcharge\" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! Outside of opening the bottle and pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?\n\nNeedless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.",

They paid attention to the little things that mattered like re-filling up your water when your cup is empty, and coming back every 10 minutes or so to ask if you need anything else.

Then added a junk of Parmesan cheese and yuuum.\n\nIn other fancy, classy and upscale joints I feel uncomfortable to even speak to my serious server. Not this guy. Our server was casual yet still very serious about his job. He even cracked a smile a few times. \n\nI cannot rave enough about this place. It was beautiful and elegant, delicious and exciting flavors. I loved every second of Delmonico\n\nMy two small complaints\n1. The bathroom smells like wet rocks. Its has really cook huge rock walls but since its in a bathroom it smells weird. You know the smell of a dirty lake? That is the smell the bathroom had.\n2. This restaurant is inside the Venetian and VERY hard to find. There are no signs. None. Pointing you toward it. So from me to you: If you find the huge LOVE sign for the Beatles show it is directly to the right, almost hidden by the sign and the elevator.",

            "text" : "Choosing the right steakhouse in Vegas is a tough choice, considering they are a dime a dozen. I'd say we chose the wrong one. The ambiance is nice and the service is good, as any high-class restaurant should be but the steak was sub-par. I've been to many steakhouses in my day, and let me tell you; the steak was just not good. We started off the night with some appetizers and drinks that were delicious. We ordered the lobster claws and tuna tarter, which was actually pretty good. Then we got to the steak. I have to admit, I was excited because Delmonico's is known for their steak, and I am a man who loves his red meat. \n\nThe first cut was rough and filled with cartilage / fat. It was very difficult to cut through, and I had to discard it because there was hardly any meat on it, more so just fat. After two or three bites, I started to accept my fate. I had a bad cut. The meat was underseasoned and not as juicy as medium rare should be. I thought maybe the meat was on the last days of expiration or something, but all in all, it just wasn't good. At places wehere I'm spending more than 60 bucks on a ribeye, I eat everything. I mean everything, the fat, the cartilage EVEYTHING. Because it's usually that good. At Delmonico's, I left half the plate. My advice, save your money for a better steakhouse. This one is overrated.",

The itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\nI had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nThe protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nAs for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nYou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.\n\nOn the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  It is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas for the short time you're there.",

I would bow down to the cow that produced this steak.\n\nAs you can see, I'm offering a ringing endorsement for this Emeril-owned establishment. It is, hands down, the best steak I've ever had. They cook the meat to perfection, slightly bloody, just the way I like it, and crusted with a seasoning that offers just enough taste to add flavor to the steak, but not to take away from the meaty perfection.\n\nBesides the steak, the cheese fondue with mini-pretzels is unbelievably creamy and delicious. I could drink it.\n\nDelMonico's isn't cheap, but hell, this is Vegas. You're supposed to indulge, and this is a great place to do it. \n\nI'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews from other Yelpers, but all I can say is, I've been here three times, and the steak is still oh-so-close to my heart (and even closer to my stomach). \n\nReservations must be made significantly in advance.

Followed by the creamed corn, very different with a strong jalapeno flavor. Fingerling potatoes standard.\n* Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: Emerill's famous banana cream pie is huge - stacked high with chunks of fresh banana. The cream needed more banana flavor, seemed overwhipped, and the crust could've been more buttery. Was still good though.\n* Key Lime Pie - 3.5 stars: Really good key lime pie on an excellent crust, a little too sweet for me though.\n* German chocolate cake - 2 stars: Cake tasted airy, reminded me of box cake. Prefer Duncan Hines (sorry!).\n* Chateaubriand - 2.5 stars: Had an incredibly tender well-seasoned Tomahawk at Beauty and Essex, and in close second was Carnevino's.

My friend's 4 year old daughter can make this dish.\n*Filet Mignon-medium rare: was the toughest filet mignon I EVER HAD!!!  WTF?!?!?  It was cooked correctly, but TOUGH at $50 for 9oz.  The filet I had at Outback was much more tender. \n*Grits w/bacon and white cheddar: If you like steel cut oats, you'll like this, which I do.  Not creamy like most grits.  Has texture.\n*Banana cream pie: OMG... I LOVE banana cream pie, but this was really bad.  The cream was sooo thick it was almost like a dense cake.  It looks impressive because of the layers of banana.  The flavor wasn't there. Safeways' banana cream pie is MUCH BETTER!! \n\nI also had a cocktail and a glass of red wine.  My meal came up to almost $200.  I don't mind paying the price if the food was worth it... IT WAS NOT!!!  \n\nNot coming back here again.\n\n1 star for the waitress who was very attentive\n1 star for the hostess who got me a table quickly",

            "text" : "Given the big name attached to this place (Emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, I had high hopes. Sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n\nI made reservations via Yelp/OpenTable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first \"just us\" trip to Las Vegas.\n\nIt was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. When we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. I then asked them to take her coat and they responded that Delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. Strike one.\n\nThe hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. That was a small, but nice touch.\n\nI had expected Delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. I almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but I understand it is Vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. But it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n\nThe waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (Renee, I believe it was). I had to ask for the wine list. Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.\n\nRenee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n\nThe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n\nThis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that I had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\n\nOur food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. We had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. She had the lobster bisque which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. I had the duck prosciutto flatbread. The duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n\nAlmost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n\nShe ordered the filet and I had the bone-in rib-eye. Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n\nThe sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.\n\nThe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. We finished dinner within 1 hour. Strike three.\n\nTotal damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. We've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. It's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.\n\nThere are many better options available in Vegas.",

Although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the filet mignon just for its AMAZING tenderness. I'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all I will say is this: perfection. And you HAVE to pair the steaks with the house red wine. It transformed our meal even more.\n\nAnd for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and I wanted to cry. That honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. I took one bite, and wanted to cry. \"It was the best tasting dessert I had ever had in my life\" is an understatement.\n\nFinally, I loved the look of the restaurant. It wasn't as dimly lit was I thought it would be, which I actually was pleasantly surprised about because I'm tired of not being able to see my food. The design is very minimalist but still very sophisticated.. but not TOO sophisticated that regular folks like my boyfriend and I didn't feel out of place.\n\nAlthough it was incredibly expensive, the food and the overall experience was so incredible that even my boyfriend, who can be pretty frugal sometimes, said that Delmonico's HAS to be a place we go back to EVERY year.

But, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get in.  Not too bad. But in the 20 mins we were there, the line never moved. \"Sports Bar\" or not, I should have known if it bears Emeril's name then a reservation should be made. So off we went to find a spot for football Sunday and came upon a sign at Delmonico announcing Sunday Football specials in the bar.  The bar was loaded with every liquor bottle imaginable and the menu... We'll it's Emeril Lagasse so enough said. We took a seat and ordered what turned out to be the best meal of our trip! My boyfriend and I ordered up a couple of cold beers, Truffled Parmesan Chips and Lobster Sliders to share. OH EM GEE!!  The Sliders were amazing! Nicely toasted roll filled with a creamy, perfectly seasoned lobster salad. No skimping on the lobster either. Nice, tender chunks and crisp pieces of celery for added crunch. Delish! The chips... We'll, we ordered another batch.. They were THAT good!  Crisp, crunchy, chips drizzled with truffle oil for that earthy yumminess and sprinkled with some tangy grated Parmesan. At halftime, we followed up with the Grilled Ricotta and Tomato Soup. Fantastic! Thick layer of creamy Ricotta and Basil between slices of buttered grilled toast. Not sure if the soup was intended for dipping but that's what we did! The soup was light and tangy -perfect for taking our ricotta sandwich for a dip!!  Meal was amazing & staff was friendly ( Michelle was super attentive). This isn't your Carlos and Charlie's or Senior Frogs so don't let the \"football specials\" fool you.

Truth to be told, I was little envy, but was also very excited to finally get to go here after missing out two years ago.\n\nI'm not really big on name of a chef nor do I care about so much about the branding of the place. Here's the funny thing.... I was excited in going to Dan Marino's place only because it was in HOOTERS. \n\nSee, it really doesn't amount to much.\n\nMy dining companion and I made a lunchtime reservation after realizing we couldn't squeezed all the places we wanted to go on this trip. We had already set up a reservation for dinner at Bouchon (at the same hotel at the Venetian) later on the night, so we compromised and reserved a table for Delmonico's for lunch.\n\nIt was an adventure finding place along the restaurant row. We had a harder time finding Bouchon later on the evening, but to get it out the way....this place is next to Aquaknox and the entrance is all the way towards the end of the hall.\n\nThe place was specular. Very classy and refine by the elegance of the look to the place. it's a bit more than what I expected for a fine dining. I guess I was assuming steakhouse in the form of Morton's, but this place outdone itself by making it more classier and upscale than any of the Morton's.\n\nFor lunch, it was casual. Not dressy as it was listed in the profile.\n\nThe lunch menu was very limited. I was almost going to be sorely disappointed because the menu's best item was dry beef sirloin. However my mood was lifted when the waitress presented us with steak menu that normally is on the dinner, but will be serve at lunch as well. \n\nThat was a big relief because I did not want to get stuck with dry aged beef. I proceeded to order Filet Mignon for myself while my partner in crime decided to take one of their special. \n\nThe coolest thing I saw on the menu was a Truffle Parmesan Potato Chip for appetizer. It was a great start to a great meal because I just couldn't get enough of that chip. What amazed me even more was the fact that it was a seasoned POTATO CHIP. Who else would be insane enough to order that for appetizer for $9?\n\nYeah...us!\n\nWe have gotten great service throughout our meal and gotten constant check up from the staff. Anywhere from our wait staff to refill our water and house baked bread (which included the butter with a shade of letter \"D\") to the chef who came to make sure that the steak was to my liking after changing for the better.\n\nI had ordered it Medium Well, the chef changed it to Medium/Medium rare because the meat was excellent cut that day and I guessed he didn't want to overcook the meat to lose the flavor. Honestly, that was a good decision on his part because the steak was that good. I savored every bite and the meat didn't drip of blood. That would have been too much, but luckily it wasn't.\n\nThe other thing I highly recommend to get was their creme of corn and lobster soup. That was rich in texture, very creamy without being too diluted. That soup itself would make a great meal if they decided to offer it in the menu as a large bowl. The soup was that good.\n\nFor $70, that was a fine meal and I have no regret. Even though the slot machines that was not far away was calling me all day.\n\nOur table was part of the wine tasting lounge. They have a few table that has an open window wall that overlooked the mall of restaurants. it makes it a nice people watching opportunity that scenesters would love. The bar and the lounge sofas are a bit high class for a normal wine tasters, but for the quiet soothing atmosphere this place presents, these things goes very well in that room.\n\nThere is a bigger dining room, but I think dinner would filled it up more. I suggest getting the table there next to the window so that people can watch you eat with jealousy....just kidding!\n\nTo my amazement, I didn't utter the famous catchphrase \"Bam!\" I might as well since I had a wonderful meal with steak that was cooked just right. if it was a romantic dinner, I would have gave it an awesome \"Bam!\" \n\nI would definitely try to make it back here again next time when I'm in Vegas.\n--------------------\nQuality: *****\nDecor: *****\nService:****\nAmenity: ****\nAmbiance: *****",

An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer's market for a fraction of the price. And it's not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you're going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it's not worth it.\n\nIf you're wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.",

There were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new Build A Bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! How cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, shrimp cocktail should be named prawn cocktail, and the squash ravioli - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. Every time I see lobster bisque, I order it for the kids, they LOVE it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. Hubby had the ribeye steak, I had the filet mignon, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and colorado rack of lamb. I think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. Very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! We shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. The pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. Again, expensive, but money well spent. Will come back again for sure!",

The ahi and salmon tasted very fresh.  The fish is divied by a small amount of seaweed salad.  It's served with wonton chips, cucumber/onion \"salad\", and a trio of wasabi sauces.  For dinner I ordered the ribeye steak.  It was HUGE.  I was expecting small portions since it's the case at most fancy restaurants. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish my steak.  And most hotels in Vegas do not have a fridge or microwave in the room.  So, I couldn't take it with me.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding with butter pecan ice cream, chocolate cake, and pecan pie.  And these were not your typical \"pecan pie\" or \"chocolate cake\".  They were all delicious and decadent! You have to try them to really understand.  Overall, my dining experience was wonderful.

I started off by ordering the wilted spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette that was absolutely to die for that I ended up licking the plate. They also did a very cool soft-boiled egg that was then fried and one of the first I'd ever seen and pull it off perfect.  My main dish was perfectly cooked and super tasty ( the barbecued salmon dish).  It was served on top of a bacon potato hash and I ordered the cream corn as a side dish.  Yum yum yum!!!  I wanted to put that potato hash in my pocket and take it home!. I would highly recommend this for anyone coming in and if my review were only based on this then I would give it a five star!  Unfortunately it's not...The other four people in our party decided to order steaks and all of them disliked them...I am from Texas so I never make the mistake of ordering a steak outside of Texas because I am almost always let down.  Our server was mean and did not do her job well. She seemed that it was almost more of an annoyance when we wanted to order anything!  I hate to say it but come on, You're in Vegas as a high end server....The wait time in between drink orders seemed extremely longer than normal and when the manager finally came over to address the steaks, he did nothing....Even though my food was perfect the whole experience was just off-putting and The Decour of the restaurant needs a major overhaul. Bland and boring....I also found it very unprofessional that they had about 15 chairs stacked in the hallway between the restaurant on your way to the bathroom....anyway I hate giving this restaurant only two stars but I want everybody to know...",

Its an incredible spot. I love everything about it.  We were seated and given a menu.  After about a few minutes were decided to run with the bone in ribeye.  Boy was I in for a treat, tasty treat.  The meat was super juicy.  The juices flowed through with every bite.  Cooked to perfection, this piece of steak is highly recommended in my books.   To be honest, when it arrived I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to finish it but after several bites, I kept at it, wanting more.  \n\nOverall this was actually one of my favorite restaurants.  I caught a glimpse of this spot a few years back and had been wanting to give it a try ever since.  Finally I was able to and it was worth it.  The bone in ribeye is definitely my favorite for about 55 bucks.  The filet was solid too I'm told by my counterpart, but no regrets on my end.  We had a lovely time.

We let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. We were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.\n\nEvery time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. In addition to the lobster bisque, french escargot, cream corn gratinne, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) I had the hot Alaskan King Crab Legs and my husband had the Bone in RibEye. He said \"it is the best steak he has ever had\" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  The noise was moderate, besides I'm in Vegas and I wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  Even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.  \n\nIt has become one of our favorite places to go and we will definitely come back again!",

For drinks, I ordered a High West rye Manhattan and it arrived perfectly mixed; maybe the smoothest Manhattan I've ever imbibed. Ceaser salad very good, but no anchovies. Two of us split chateaubriand and it was perfect, although presentation was somewhat boring. The potatos and asparagus were good but not spectacular. Another friend got the fillet and it was so tender she started cutting it with get butter knife and didn't even notice! The wine list is overwhelming. 93 pages. It's better to know what you want and see  if it's there than to try and choose. The decor is somewhat vanilla, but nice.  Also, the place is huge - much larger inside than what you see when you walk in off Restaurant Row in The Palazzo.  The crowd made for pretty fun people watching; there seemd to be a lot of middle aged men with their much younger \"dates.\"  Maybe it was \"take your niece to dinner\" night.

Since we had 10, they had to put us on two separate tables, which was ok, because they were right next to each other anyway.\n\nDecor:  nothing spectacular.  i thought it was alittle too dim for me.  I like a well lit restaurant for the purpose of really getting to see the different colors of your food and wine.  You can tell a lot about your food by it's color...it's freshness, it's doneness, etc.\n\nFood:  Very good.  I had the filet and it was super tender.  My buddies ordered the bone in rib-eye and almost all said it was amongst the best steaks they ever had.  Everything is a la carte so we shared sides of grilled asparagus (good), garlic smashed potatoes (yummy), sauteed wild mushrooms (yummy), and caesar salad (good).\n\nService:  Very good also.  Our waiter was very polite even when our rowdy half drunk group couldn't decide on what to order.  He was very helpful with the wine and picked out a nice bottle of merlot that worked with our budget.  Server's were very fast and attentive.  They made sure everything was perfect...which pretty much was.\n\nPrice:  Pretty fair and expected of a high end steak house.  bone in 20 oz. rib-eye was about $50 and my 12 oz. filet was around $45.  Sides were around $8-12, and one order feeds 2 people.  Yes, they have an extensive wine list and Yes, they have seafood also.\n\nOne last important note:  there isn't a smoking/non-smoking section, so people with kids, and non-smokers beware.",

Then we moved on to the Foie Gras and Oysters. Both Anna and I were trying to play nice and say, \"Here, you take the last bite.\", but deep down we wanted it all to ourselves!!!

Grilled right in front of you to a Medium Rare perfection. This was also accompanied with asparagus and mashed potatoes (I had them add some truffles to the mashers. Well it is my birthday!!!).

Ordered steak tartare for an appetizer and fell in love. It comes with an egg yolk over the top which gives it a wonderful velvety taste. Decent portion although I could have eaten much more. Next we shared the tomato and burrata salad. The burrata was the best I've had....so creamy and rich. Delicious! For our entree, we shared the Chateaubriand. Holy crap was it amazing! The first bite literally melted in my mouth. It's served with asparagus which was super fresh and crisp. We substituted fingerling potatoes for the mashed potatoes and were very happy with our decision. We also added foie gras, which was delicious. I seriously could eat the steak ever day though.... It's one of the best I've ever had. For dessert, we were interested in the bread pudding but went with the suggestion of 2 different servers and ordered the pecan pie. Holy shit it was incredible. Not your typical pecan pie....it's made with oats and love and magic. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. We come to Vegas and splurge on a nice dinner once a year, typically going somewhere new each time, but there's a chance we'll make a repeat visit next year.

We were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. Our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. We never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). Even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a VERY good syrah that fitted within our budget.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, we ordered the bbq shrimp, filet mignons, lobster tail, and I ordered the rib eye. Seriously, every bite was WOW! Cooked to exactly the way you ask!!! You have to try it for yourself and you'll understand the WOW factor this restaurant has!\n\nWhile making my reservations, I noted that it was a special dinner for me and my wife, along with my friend and his wife (our anniversaries of dating). lol...anyways, when we were about to ask for our check, the staff came out with two bowls of fresh strawberry sherbert/sorbet with a candle in it, followed by the words \"Happy Anniversary to you both and Thank You for coming to Delmonicos\"! I wanted to stand and applaud! hahahah Our server then went on to take our digital camera's and take a couple pics of us.\n\nIf you're looking for a restaurant with that WOW factor (and you love meat), I highly recommend visiting Delmonico's.",

The sides were not bad. Our server really hyped up the creamed corn, which came much later and I did not see what the big deal was about. It was again just ok.\n\nThe desserts were pretty good, our table enjoyed them. I ordered the bread pudding ala mode and having had the some spectacular bread puddings recently, I did not think this was anything amazing but still not bad.\n\nOne thing to mention though - because our server had forgotten our last side order, it was on the house. tells you alot about the quality of service at this place.\n\nI probably will try out other options on the strip before coming back here. Given that it's Vegas, there are some really good options. Unfortunately Delmonico wasn't a super memorable experience for me, but for a well-made dinner in a nice restaurant, this place is spot on.",

We were seated quickly on a Friday late night, woohoo, it's gonna be a good night.\n\nI like their menu, it was short and sweet only 2 pages, took us only 2 mins to pick our food.\n\nWe had applewood bacon, barbecue shrimp, lobster bisque, gumbo, bone in filet which was the house special of the day and also rack of lambs with chimichurri sauce.  \n\nThe applewood bacon was indeed a thick cut of pork belly, which was quick greasy, the flavor is good but it was so oily I couldn't have more than one bite, I didn't care much about it.  \n\nThe star of the night was the barbecue shrimp, highly recommend by the waiter, glad we took his advice, it was so delish! It was not the usual bbq sauce that u had before, this New Orleans style bbq sauce had a little tarted, smoky, spice, touch of sweet. Oh man... I literally licked the plate! Oops ... Not very lady like! \n\nLobster bisque was another surprise, it was rich and velvety with punch of flavors, came with chunks of lobster meats... It was perfect.\n\nComparing to the lobster bisque, gumbo was just ok, I was a little disappointed Coz gumbo was such a authentic plate represent Cajun creole cuisine.

Clean and well-kept. \n\nService: The service was generally pretty good from the two support staff assisting our primary server. Our main server, however, was quite underwhelming to say the least. It was apparent from the moment he greeted us that he wasn't enthused to have a 2 top sit down (at a table for 2 no less). I mentioned to the server that I was interested in an appetizer to share, but didn't want something so large as to prevent me from fully enjoying the steak I had decided on. He ignored my question for a suggestion. I've never had that happen, anywhere, let alone a fine-dining establishment. The worst part, however, came to the bill. To set the stage, we were seated adjacent to two other 2-top tables, one of which was behind us in the meal progression, the other who was ahead of us. Several moments after our dessert and after dinner-drinks were dropped off, our bill was placed on our table with the statement \"I'll take this as soon as you are ready.\" Interesting . . . I looked at the table next to us, who had already finished dessert and they did not have their bill yet. And on top of that, he failed to ask us if we wanted anything else, which had he asked, he would have realized that my wife would have liked more hot water for her tea. My wife was also thoroughly irritated with the fact that the bill was explicitly placed within my reach, and not hers. She made it a point to the server that she was the one who wished to pay.\n\nFood: We were both completely and 100% underwhelmed with everything we ordered. I had the \"house special\" which was a dry aged, bone-in ribeye, reportedly seasoned with Emril's Essence. It was a good steak. Not great by any means, and most certainly not worth the $52 price tag. The flavor was mediocre (surprising since its purportedly dry-aged), and the cook highly inconsistent. It was ordered medium rare, and parts were rare, others were medium. Very disappointing and suggestive of an amateur grill chef. I'm quite content to pay that much and far more for a good steak, however, I expect to get what I pay for, and this was most certainly not it. I've had far superior steaks for less than 1/2 that price.  My wife ordered the snapper, and it was so overcooked that it was mostly inedible. Also had the mushroom side, which was generally pretty good.\n\nThe dessert, however, was quite good. The banana creme pie.\n\nPerhaps we went on an off night, however, this experience coupled with the abundance of other restaurants on the strip, is enough for me to never return.",

Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he's not the one cooking my meal, then it's not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that's for sure.\n\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio's buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you're saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\n\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn't stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet's looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn't a proper meal we would've gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \"Generous Cut\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\n\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I've ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\n\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They're one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\n\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\n\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.",

From the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. We were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nThe atmosphere inside Delmonico's is not at all what I would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. The colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, I need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nWe started with some truffle potato chips and a tomato salad to share while we were getting settled. Vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. Ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with Chambolle Musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of Sancerre to start. \n\nI ended up getting Emeril's famous bone-in ribeye, Vince got the filet, and Phil and Alexandra got BBQ shrimp and mushroom medallions. We also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic smashed potatoes. For someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. Cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of Emeril's Essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. Vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. I was impressed with Alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. I'd had the shrimp before at Emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. The spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\nI finished up with some pecan pie, a generous Jamaica Blue Mountain espresso (I was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac.

With that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit I'm afraid Delmonico should have been even better. This year we had a large company dinner at Delmonico, so I was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp and the butternut squash ravioli. The shrimp was good but a little overcooked. The squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. I loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  I also tried the truffle potato chips, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nThe lobster bisque was textbook, exactly what lobster bisque is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. Still I might have preferred my neighbor's heirloom tomato salad, which I tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  I didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nFor my entrée I had the Delmonico signature steak - a bone-in ribeye. This is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. The steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. My order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and I thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks I've had in Las Vegas, at all price points. One of my close work friends who has frequented Delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. Of the sides I loved the creamed corn. Next time I'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which I found undercooked and under seasoned. The asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nThe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but I'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. Best bite of the night. One of the best I've had. Wonderful.",

            "text" : "So this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. Let me start out by saying this is my 3rd Emeril's restaurant in Vegas. The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. \nThe service and customer service here is exceptional. \n\nWe tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake. \nMost of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again. \nThe filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. \n\nWhen asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work.",

Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said \"you know there is a $25 fee for corkage\". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \"let somebody know\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.",

I chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value. \n\nOrdered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red. \n\nThe service was excellent for the entire meal. The table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like Yorkshire pudding. The house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what I ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good. \n\nWas served quickly, if I had clients with me I would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated. \n\nThe asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. The ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. The waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, I decided on the filet. I was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. Also served fresh asparagus. \n\nDessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. Both very good. The pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. The crust was very favorable and went well with the Carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream. \n\nOther notes, good lighting and I liked the architectural ceiling. Chairs are stylist and very comfortable. I recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. Never like sitting near restroom entrance, which I was; as much as I like most people watching I would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. Lastly white sugar cubes, really?",

            "text" : "LOVE me some Delmonico! \nAs a big fan of Emeril Lagasse, I had to stop in to one of his restaurants in Vegas, and figured I would have to eat here for my birthday dinner. Definitely, definitely worth it.\nFirst off, if you're stopping in, I would recommend making reservations beforehand, as it can get quite busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Love the fact that it's in the Venetian, as that's usually my go to hotel in Vegas, and very easy to get to from the Casino floor.\nVery casual atmosphere, but very upscale service. Our server was fantastic, and we were well taken care of from the moment we stepped in. First class all the way.\nThe food was everything I was hoping for and more. Had calimari for an appetizer- delicious. The bread that came with the meals- delicious. Decided on the filet mignon for main course, with sides of creamed corn and cheese grits. Spectacular. The filet mignon was the best steak I've ever had, bar none. Cooked PERFECTLY, it just melted in my mouth, and you couple that with the creamed corn, which seriously could be the best vegetable I've ever eaten, and holy smokes, you've got yourself a classic meal. \nSince it was my birthday, I decided on the root beer float for desert. Awesome. It was a New Orleans root beer served with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was awesome. Just awesome. Plus side- the servers hooked me up with a free chocolate cake type desert because it was my special day! I felt so loved!\nOverall, I LOVE Delmonico. The prices are a lot more than you'd pay for an outback or longhorn, but that should be a given. The service was spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, and the food out of this world. If you're looking for a delicious steak dinner on the strip, it doesn't get any better than Emeril's Delmonico. Oh yeah, babe.",

The halibut was well cooked and delicate. The black-rice risotto was different but overall, this dish was not real exciting.\n\nMy family's dishes: \n-Chateaubriand: at $120 for 2 people, this was probably the best deal since it's the only one that came with sides of asparagus and mashed potatoes.\n-Filet Mignon\n-Rib Eye\n-Broccoli side\n-Baked potato\n\nThey thought the rub was a little too salty and the rib eye meat to not be as high quality. The filet mignon and chateaubriand got a \"pretty good\" otherwise.\n\nThe service here is very good. I'd say the decor is lacking. In a strip of restaurants in a 5 star hotel, it wasn't very grand and the entrance was easy to miss. It could have felt fancier.\n\nAll in all, an ok first time at an Emeril restaurant.",

Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \n\nEntree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \n\nSide Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \n\nMy friend's side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c'mon.   \n\nDessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nService: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n\nTip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I'm glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.",

It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nWe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late.

Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nOur cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend's fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \n\nThe sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum.

We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \n\nFirst came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,\"Damn I'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks\" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \n\nThen came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.",

The seating was very prompt, they pull out your chair and place your napkin on your lap.. very fancy. \n\nThe bread is like a hollow croissant roll which is delicious! They bring one at a time but it's unlimited. The butter comes on a design on a small plate.\n\nOur drinks were tasty, came quickly.\n\nFor an appetizer we got the king crab deviled eggs. They were good... nothing too special honestly.\n\nEntrees were the rib eye and filet and shareable sides were the mushrooms and gratin potatoes. Steaks were cooked to perfection, mushrooms were amazing. Potatoes tasted like plain scalloped potatoes, could've used more seasoning and cheese.\n\nDessert was pecan pie with caramel and vanilla ice cream.. amazing. \n\nThe service was great, our waters were never once empty, plates always cleared and food came out quickly.\n\nOver all it was a great date and experience. I would highly recommend if you haven't been. Being out of state we probably wouldn't go back because there are hundreds of other places for us to try first and we don't go to Vegas that often.",

Not worth ordering again in the future. I had to of course order the bone-in ribeye for my entree. It's disappointing to me when a steakhouse doesn't cook a steak the way you had requested... especially a high end one such as this. I ordered medium-rare. It was definitely cooked medium. I don't usually send food back because other people are with me and I'd have to make them wait. I can still enjoy my food if it's not perfect. However, I do make a note of it on my reviews so that the chefs and future customers know. I'm sure this isn't a mistake that they make regularly (At least I hope not!). I also prefer a saltier steak. It could have used more fat too. I like my hypertension and cholesterol... The sides we ordered for the table were all delicious. Mushrooms & creamed corn were probably the best. Creamed spinach and gratin were just okay. I tried some of my friend's chicken. It was pretty good, but the sides it came with were the most impressive. \n\nAs expected from a nice steakhouse such as this, the service was excellent.",

I was here for a couple friends' birthdays, and everybody at my table ordered one appetizer to go with the steaks we ordered.  As good as everything was, we just ended up staring at our food 20 minutes after being served.\n\nAs for the food, as I stated, it's all terrific.  The complimentary bread is some of the best I've ever had.  They're delicate to the touch, and when you bite into it, the texture is flakier than a croissant.  I didn't even know that was possible with a roll.  \n\nI had the lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was creamy and some decent chunks of lobster in it.  For the record, I actually finished it.  Another person at our table ordered the seafood tower which is something you should get on a big baller budget, but everything from the oysters, to the lobster, and crab claws were scrumptious.  The country smashed potatoes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, truffle parmesan potato chips, and duck fat fingerling potatoes?  All amazing.\n\nNow, the steak.  Most of them are dry-aged, so we're talking $$$ here, but like my fellow Yelper Ferdinand L. said, do not attempt to have a steak without the foie gras on top.  If you've never had foie gras before, this is the time to do it.  The result is something you'll simply salivate over.\n\nNow it wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was one of those situations where after eating here, I know most things after will be a disappointment, so choose your next meal wisely.  My whole table had the meat stares, and only one person at the table finished their entree.\n\nJust a great dining experience.",

Since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nTo start off, some of us had the salmon and tuna tartare, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, shrimp cocktail, and lobster bisque. They were all quite tasty! \n\nThe BF and I shared a Bone-in Ribeye. Asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. I was disappointed since I really hate eating well done meat. Luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or I'd definitely have to have it recooked. I also had an addition of seared Foie Gras as well - which was the absolute BEST part of my meal. The flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, I found myself wanting more still!\n\nAlong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: buttered asparagus, buttered broccoli, creamed spinach, sauteed garlic mushrooms, mash potatoes, creamed corn gratinee, and potato gratin. All the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. I loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nAs full I already was, I saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course I couldn't pass up on that. Glad I didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nService was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is!

They were dry. They were rough. I ordered a medium rare and it came out medium. It was NOT tender. It took a lot more effort to chew than it should for something that's $52. There were NO flavor in it and the seasoning was quite lacking.\n\nWhat the f*ck happened?!?!!!??!!! The steaks tasted like they were fresh steaks versus the dry aged ones that they advertised. \n\n\nTHEIR SERVICE IS FANTASTIC AND IMPECCABLE. \n\nWe had brought up the issue with one of the servers and the manager of the location, Doug, took care of us. My friend's steak, and so was mine, was done three times to see if we were happy with the results. My friend's steak was pretty much rare when she ordered medium rare so they tried to correct that for her. They took the steaks off the check and gave us complimentary desserts. \n\nEven though they tried to correct my steak and even though they had amazing service, I'm not sure if their quality control is at work anymore. The quality was a good 180. The piece of meat they gave me was comparable to a $20 steak from Outback or any other random cheap joint versus the $52 price tag. It could be a bad batch, it could be quality control, but I'm not sure if I'd return to the location.\n\nService: A+++++\nFood: F",

However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.\n\nIt was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...\n\nThe wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.\n\nNow on to the steak.- the \"signature\" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend's filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?

Perfectly seasoned and prepared steaks in the main dining room makes for a great night out, but what makes The Delmonico Steakhouse a DESTINATION is their individually planned and prepared tasting menu, available during an evening at their special Kitchen Table. \n\nThey have a glass room with space for 8, connected to the kitchen where you'll enjoy a special tasting menu prepared by the Chef on duty. And when I say special menu, I mean just that. Chefs are passionate about menu planning and specialty food and they'll give you a 6-8 course meal featuring the steak of course, and many other things not available on their menu, finished with a dessert tray to die for, featured every one of the desserts they offer. \n\nThis is an Emeril restaurant but you won't see any made for TV dinners here - it's truly an authentic steakhouse with an upscale dining room. For the wine lover, Master sommelier Kevin Vogt will work with the chef to perfectly pair wine with each course. What is special, as of my last visit, is The Delmonico Steakhouse runs independent of the other food services at The Venitian. This means they shop for their own food and manage their own wine collection. So if you enjoy fine wine, perfectly paired with your meal - this is the place for you. \n\nThis is my #1 all time favorite restaurant. The food is good enough to stand on its own, and because of the special treatment you get at the kitchen table, I've yet to experience anything so great.\n\nHow much? You'll be shocked and surprised to learn this dining experience isn't terribly expensive. For a little more than you'd spend in the dining room, you get a personal dining experience, about $85 for dinner and wine pairing for about $65.\n\nI call this a once in a lifetime experience, even though I've been lucky enough to do it about ten times.",

On this trip, the wife had the organic baby mixed greens salad and the Filet while I had the shrimp cocktail and once again the bone-in-ribeye. We also shared an order of asparagus.\n\nThe Filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. My ribeye was disappointing, however. It was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.\n\nThe service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in Vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at Craftsteak, Cut, N9ne, Stripsteak, Prime, or even STK. Does not deserve more than 3 stars IMO and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town.",

The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up!\nEmeril-you've done it right again!\nWe're going to actually try Carnevino, Batali's latest,  on our trip next month for something new, but I know we'll always visit Delmonico's!",

The wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations.

We had 10:00pm reservation on Valentine's day and were flying in to Vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  Our flight out of SFO was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  Our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  They key here was she always made us feel like she was on \"our team\" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  She helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in \"before the bell\" (as it were).  She got a $100+ tip for being a pro.\n\nFood:\nThis is a steakhouse, order a steak.  Mine was flavorful without being fatty or gristly, pink without being bloody and just the right amount charred on the outside.  This was the ribeye steak, but the bone-in ribeye ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  My wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).  \n\nCost:\nYou won't find an entree for under $50 and the sides are extra (we had a group of 6 so that actually worked out wonderfully and we ended up dining quasi-family-style).  The asparagus and mushrooms were hits!  With tip (21%), the bill came to exactly $100/person.  I think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.\n\nBottom Line:\nThe service here was friendly and professional.  The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  The food is extremely good and a decent value (it is Vegas after all).  Go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.",

We were seeing Blue Man Group that night, and this place was located right next to the theatre. And it's an Emeril restaurant. Awesome, right?\n\nWe were seated promptly for our 830 reservation. I sat down and the guy put my napkin on my lap and stepped on my foot in the process. No big deal; I'm a klutz too. Shortly thereafter, a waiter appeared, informed us that we'd have three servers that night. He then asked us if we'd like bottled or tap water, and then asked if we wanted a wine list. We answered and he went off to take care of it. Not 30 seconds later someone else (one of our other servers, I assume) showed up and gave us the exact same spiel. We answered the same way. \n\nSoon after, the first guy appeared with the wine list, which was literally 25 pages long. Ok, I both love me some wine and understand that this is a nice place, but a wine list that long is overwhelming. Yes, they had a page with Kevin's (the sommelier, I assume) picks, but still. \n\n20 minutes after we received the wine list, our server finally showed up to take our wine and food orders. We decided to split a ribeye and some potato gratin. I also got the gumbo, which was served promptly along with our wine. \n\nAs I said before, everything was delicious. The wine was great, the gumbo was extremely flavorful, the ribeye was tender and wonderful, and I also loved the potato gratin. However, when we got our food, I asked the server if he could give us the check a little early so we wouldn't have to rush to make our show (we were cutting it close, especially with the time it took for the server to come take our order). He insisted we'd have plenty of time and refused to give us the check. This is because he wanted to offer us dessert after our meal. Fine. Whatever. Still annoying. \n\nI'm hoping that this was just an off night, because it seems that most of the reviews here are very complimentary of the service. I'd be willing to give this place another shot, because the food was really that good (and actually kind of reasonably priced for what you get if you split a steak like we did). \n\nSo, we'll see...",

            "text" : "It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \n\nThe LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nV&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus. \n\nDrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \"Yes, please, another round\" after flagging someone down.  \n\nThe highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov's dog.\n\nHusband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \n\nWhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \"fine.\"\n\nManagement comped one of the two Tito's I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n\nIn all fairness, the staff at D's did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn't until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \"buyer's remorse\").\n\nSo after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \"satisfy the customer.\" Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n\nI have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \"celebrity\" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It's the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n\nSo, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril's establishments. I doubt I'll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I've left the building and think I'll stick to D's in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me.

The service was attentive but not intrusive.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  I started with the mixed greens salad and my husband got the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  I got the filet mignon and my husband got the bone in rib eye.  Both were cooked perfectly and very good, but not the best steaks we ever had.  We also got the sauteed mushrooms and country smashed potatoes for sides.  We couldn't fit in dessert.  The wine list, or book I should say, was the largest we've seen.  Definitely worth the trip and I would recommend it.",

First,we had a 5:00 reservation and there right when they opened. We had stated on our reservations that it was was our anniversary. We got no acknowledgement of it and were seated at the worst table in the restaurant in a corner with a cheap floor lamp that was covered in dust next to us. No one was even in the restaurant, so they could have given us a nice booth. It was still dead there at 6:30 when we left. On to the food. Popovers were just ok. Hubby's ribeye was yummy. My filet however, was dry as the Sahara and had no flavor. Not a speck of juice ran out when I cut into it. My hubby said it looked like jerky. So disappointed. Sides creamed spinach and twice baked potato were just ok. Twice baked was just a big greasy glob of cheese and wasn't even hot. For dessert, we got the banana cream pie. It was good but I was expecting it to wow me based on what others had said about it. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back. For the price, I'd rather have Mastros or Ruth's Chris.",

Ordered both the foie gras and the truffle Parmesan potato chips to start. They were both brought to the table at the same time so I knew I would need to eat the foie gras first which was quite good. The potato chips were great, and since I had ordered the wagyu ribeye for $90, I didn't want to fill up on the chips, I asked if they could box up the chips to take back to my room.  No problem, and they were delicious the next day! The wagyu ribeye is the best beef I've ever had! Perfect med-rare with great flavor and the most tender beef ever! I've had wagyu at other steakhouses in LV, but this blew away the competition!  The size was perfect for me: 6 or 8 ounces (I forgot which). Since this is white truffle season, I chose the white truffle ice cream that is vanilla ice cream stuffed with lots of small pieces of truffle. It is served as 3 balls which I figured I'd eat one or two, but it was so addictive that I ate the whole thing! Service was very friendly and attentive.

So this time around we enjoyed the artisanal cheeses to start and I had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. My husband enjoyed a trio of filet mignon medallions. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.\n\nI love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back.

Mine arrived with heavy spices, while the other diners' filet was more aggressively spiced, to the point it had to be sent back for a new steak.  Perhaps this special item was supposed to be spiced up more than a typical filet, but even between the two of us it was inconsistent.  Then the waitstaff disappeared again.  Our 3-course meal for 3 people took over 3 hours.\n\nAsparagus was well prepared, and the Caesar Salad was superb.  But vegetables do not a steakhouse make.

Not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. You are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area. \n\nWe had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. The seats were very very comfortable. I believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but I guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. Reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party. \n\nOur waiter or host shall I call him was very informative about just about everything! He recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how I should get my steak cooked! He was simply awesome. \n\nI order the BONE IN RIB STEAK which is also originally what the server recommended. The price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. Medium rare was perfect. The steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nso it was very easy to get every last piece off the bone. \n\nI strongly suggest you order the steak with a nice red wine. Your taste buds will be in heaven. \n\nThe sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. For some reason I was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! The side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. I put that to the side because I did not want to share with anyone. The truffle potato chips was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead. \n\nThe calamari was okay. Not worth the $14. Marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly. \n\nTHEY HAVE THE BEST WARM BREAD HERE EVER! TEST YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU CAN RESIST JUST ONE! \n\nI can finally say I ate at one of Emeril's restaurants!

We ended our evening with the duck egg crème brûlée.  My only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   I've had crème brûlée in many restaurants, and I typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.  \n\nI cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at Delmonico!

            "text" : "Amazing steak, as well as some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nMy friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. We ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nWe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in filet mignon with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  We also ordered the truffle parmesan potato chips, as well as the creamed corn gratinee and the country smashed potatoes.\n\nThe first thing to come out were the potato chips. Sadly, for a girl who eats potato chips as her main meal frequently, I couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (I cannot stand stinky cheese).  However, I did at least try ONE, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. However, the parmesan was still prominent, so I watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. I felt as if I was being punished, for some reason.\n\nLuckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were HUGE. It was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  Our server (who's name I forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. He brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  We got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nThe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. I tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and I end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). This one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nThe filet was also very tender.  While we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, I decided to test it out.  The sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. It didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  After urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nThe sides were very good as well. The creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. Definitely a trick I am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nAs great as the food was, I was also very impressed with the level of service. You would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  In addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nFor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than I expected (although I'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). However, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. That is definitely a sign of a great meal.",

I tried to give then a second chance, but this visit only confirmed the poor service from my first.  I will not be going back.",

They made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.\n\nThough we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. I thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. It was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nOur hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. Very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. Meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my Filipino friends said tasted like Filipino bread. It was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. Our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nWe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. I tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. It was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. Tender, flavorful, delicious! I loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. My other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. I loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. We got the country smashed potatoes, the baked idaho potato, and the roasted fingerling potatoes. The roasted fingerling potatoes tasted the best. I thought it was perfect the way it was salted. The other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\nDecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. The bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. The meal was delicious, but I still love Mastro's more! \n\nAt the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). He came FIVE TIMES. It was SUPER annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\nI'd definitely come here again, but after I try other steakhouses in Vegas!",

Husband and I knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n\nI ordered the ribeye with country smashed potatoes and husband got the filet mignon with creamed corn.   The side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   The creamed corn was fantastic.  It had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra BAM!  \n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque to start.   Bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   Did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n\nThe steaks were just okay.  Asked for mine medium but it came out well done so I didn't find it that good.  Husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n\nOverall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.

If you are a garlic lover you must try these mushrooms; we are and we believe we would make a return trip to the Delmonico just to order these again.\n\nWe then split a Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich which featured wonderfully marinated, expertly cooked steak with a horseradish mayo that perfectly complemented the meat. The sandwich was outstanding, and there was no extra charge for splitting it and serving us each half on own own plate. \n\nWe then decided to go for it and split a piece of Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie. This turned out to be not your ordinary banana cream pie in that there seemed to be no cream filling with the bananas. It looked like a vast number of differently shaped banana slices had been stacked on the crust in a kind of patchwork design, and yet they had done something to these bananas to make them deliciously sweet. There was a substantial amount of whipped cream on top of the slice which had been dusted with chocolate and drizzled with caramel. This pie was definitely a winner, and we regretted that we had no more room to sample some of their other desserts. \n\nWe are already planning a return visit to Delmonico Steakhouse next time we are in Vegas to further explore their menu and other items.

So we asked the waiter to bring us the Lobster Bisque instead.  It took us too long to find our server though.  To their credit, they took the french onion off of our tab.  The lobster Bisque was not special, very bland even for lobster bisque.  The shrimp came out very poor, the bbq sauce tasted burnt and the shrimp were small.  And to top the night off, my steak was medium well almost well done, when I had asked for medium rare.\n\nThe third time, I went with my friends.  The wine suggestion was poor and it was tres expensive.  Also, the food was just as mediocre as the second time I went.\n\nI give the place two stars despite the food being ok, because of the price.

If a steakhouse can manage to make my WELL-DONE steak juicy and flavorful, then FOR SURE it's a fantastic place!\"\n\nI don't remember much about any of the sides because I'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  Many a late Las Vegas night, I'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just CHEW on a slab of leftover steak.  It's even good cold.\n\nDelmonico's, the Queen of CathyLand salutes you for outstanding service and incredible food. Cheers.",

Many of the old, wealthy families of New Orleans dined there.  It was not on the tourist trail.\n\nI was distraught when Emeril bought Delmonicos.  I thought he was cheesy and obnoxious, and I just knew he was going to ruin this Southern matriarch.  I could not bring myself to go there and view the damage.\n\nThen I found out a Delmonicos had opened in Vegas.  Who cared if it is cheesy I thought...we're in Vegas, home of cheesiness!  So, Sugar Bear and I checked it out in 2001.  \n\nWe were delighted to see that there was a strict dress code.  Our meal was splendifferous.  The presentation--stunning.  The restaurant--breathtaking.  I could not believe it!  Delmonicos had not been ruined by Emeril after all.  He had taken my favorite old school restaurant from New Orleans and made her into a youthful Southern Belle again.  We were dazzled.\n\nWe returned to Delmonicos a year later to celebrate our wedding.  Perfect.\n\nWe've been several times since, and have always loved our meals.  It has been disappointing that the dress code has become lax.  Last time we were there, we saw jeans and shorts.  Downgrade for a place that previously required a coat.

I didn't leave the restaurant replaying every bite. We ordered the heirloom tomato soup (with grilled cheese sandwich), mac and cheese, crab legs, and two steaks. I got the special steak of the day that came with shaved pieces of truffle on top. Don't get me wrong. Everything was delicious and I had no problem with my food, but it just wasn't memorable. \n\nAmbiance (3.5): It's a fancy restaurant but felt like any other bougie restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel. We were seated at a corner table but there definitely could have been some more space between us and the pair next to us.\n\nService (4): Service was also a positive experience. Our waiter was pleasant and friendly and made small talk with us. And when my date found a long curly hair mixed into his crab legs, the waiter apologized and took it back without a second thought. When he came back with a new plate the legs looked like they came from the fattest crabs possible.\n\nSo overall, a wonderful experience and I would have no qualms about returning.

Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\n\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn't the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\n\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\"Would you like some more bread sir?\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \"Better!\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\n\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\n\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\n\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.

Um NO, we were there and waited for about 45 minutes and left.  Then he was apologetic and offered to comp our dinner if we were to come back, but I was flying out that day and had to decline that offer.

I do give Emeril or the chef who cooked my steak credit in which the steak had an awesome flavor in every bite i took but still the meal is nothing more than average! I would give Delmonico's a 3 1/2 star!",

You expect a steakhouse to have that rich dark woods atmosphere.  This was very bland and nondescript in a city that does things to an excess..  The steak, a bone in ribeye was good but not OMG.  Barbecue shrimp appetizer and popovers were delicious.  Side dishes including the Au gratin potatoes were fair.  Banana cream pie is a must have.

The wait staff had a great sense of humor which added to the night's festivities (hell they were serving a bunch of goofballs).  Of course, the best part was the steak.  Most of us at the table had the bone in ribeye steak.  Let me first say I didn't eat much of anything that day in anticipation of this dinner and we didn't have any appetizers or salads and I STILL couldn't finish off that piece of meat!

This made everything seem special for my wife, who had no idea we were coming here.  Then we were taken to our table.\n\nWe were given a near endless wine list (book!) and expected to decide from there?  No, the sommelier came over and determined our wine for us, and did not pick the most expensive bottle, but one of the best ones we have had, for way less than the next closest we had drank a while back.\n\nThe menu is not too over the top, but just right.  I wanted to have the escargot, but my wife cannot bring herself to eat this, so we had the BBQ shrimp.  Being from Texas, we love barbeque, but this was different, and superb.  Four huge shrimp covered in a sauce that I have never had the likes of before.  Our main entrée was the Chateaubriand cooked tableside.  I enjoy my steak rare to med-rare, but my wife does not like to see blood in her steak. (I know, I'm working on this)  They were able to cook the same piece of meat to my liking as well as hers and it came out perfect.  Not a thing was left on either of our plates. \n\nWe concluded the meal with two desserts, I had Emeril's banana cream pie.  An incredible end to a wonderful meal.  My wife had the crème bruele,  and explained it in details I have never heard her use to explain food.  On top of this, we were given a small sample of sorbet with a happy anniversary not written in chocolate on the plate.\n\nThere were so many waiters and helpers taking care of our every need that it was almost impossible to say who was the actual waiter, although the main waiter was superb.  He took over for the cook at our table because he knew exactly how we wanted the steak, and never did he let anything sit out of place, no drink ran low, and not one thing was missed.\n\nAgain, amazing can not explain how great this meal was.  We will definitely stop again next time we are in Vegas!\n\nI knew how much it would be before we went, but for the sake of a review, I will say our meal for two was right at $300, but well worth it.

There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.\n\nFor starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand. \n\nFor dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.\n\nThe waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) \n\nThe manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. \n\nFor the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. \n\nThe bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!\n\nMy filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon. \n\nDesserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it. \n\nMy only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as \"the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for.\" \n\nI personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience. \n\nIf this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.",

            "text" : "TL;DR: Decent steakhouse that matches its price tag; what you might expect in 5 star Vegas hotels. Not a bad option if you have $60 to drop on steak. \n\nWhile this steakhouse might not be anything noteworthy apart from the celebrity status of its owner, Emeril Lagasse, it serves solid food for an albeit expensive price. To be fair, though, we need to recognize that it is located in a 5-star hotel on the Las Vegas strip, one of the most tourist-saturated areas on Earth, where you can expect to be overcharged for everything. That being said, this steakhouse does what every steakhouse should to a fair standard.\n\nThe service here is as good as you would expect at a fancy steakhouse. The free bread here is unusual, though; it seems to be a hollow roll formed by a shell of Pillsbury croissant dough, which isn't bad, but isn't especially good either. USDA Prime steaks go for around $50-$60, and are enough to feed 2 people, or one really hungry person. I ordered the steaks medium-rare, and they were cooked to order, maybe a hair closer to a medium. The steaks had a good charred crust, a mark of a good steak and something difficult to achieve at home. They offer two complimentary steak sauces, both of which pair well with the steak. I'm personally a fan of ribeye steaks and recommend that cut above anything else at a steakhouse like this one. Sides are typical, and the asparagus was nothing special but good as it was. \n\nWhile Emeril may never have set foot in this steakhouse, it certainly does not disappoint. While it may not be as great as some of the most famous steakhouse in NYC, Delmonico does a good job at serving beef in the middle of a touristy destination. While it probably isn't worth more than the effort of a short walk to get to, if you're staying at the Palazzo or Venetian and are looking for a fancy steak dinner, this restaurant is a solid option.",

There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.\n\nNow let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. \n\nSo they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT! \n\nThen it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? \n\nAnd as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place. \n\nThe restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.

In those travels I go to a large number of steakhouses, many are wonderful, some are unimpressive, a few, well a few are just unbelievable.\n\nService is never the biggest scale tipper for me, but I understand it is very important for some people.  The service at Delmonico is impeccable.  Dishes are cleared away quickly, menu items are explained in necessary detail, drinks are always full, and complaints are addressed quickly and quietly.\n\nDecor generally means little to my review.  I appreciate aesthetics as much as the next 30-something, but a bare room with nothing on the walls isn't going to change my number of stars, and to be honest, I couldn't even tell you what Delmonico looks like on the inside, I don't care, the only thing that matters is those steaks.\n\nI prefer my steak in the form of a ribeye.  Bone-in or boneless, I don't really care.  I order it rare+ with a hard sear (some may call it Pittsbugh, sometimes I do).  At Delmonico I got myself the boneless ribeye, rare+ with a hard sear, and they brought it to me rare+ with a hard sear.  This was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten in my life.  It reminded me of the first time I ate at a real steakhouse when I was in my early 20s, it caused this awakening inside of me, of what I may have been missing in the world.  There was a crunch as you cut into it, and then a soft slide through buttery, perfectly cooked meat, with a hint of salt once you put it in your mouth.

The best is their sausages, I went through a period of sausage craving during my pregnancy and this was the only breakfast joint where the sausage flavour hit the spot and brought back lots of childhood memories.  The bacon is always cooked to perfection (as per my hubby) and the portions are generous.  \n\nOur only thing is that the place gets quite smoky from the cooking and sometimes they got to open their patio doors a little to let some of the smoke out.  It's happened during the middle of winter but lucky it was a mild winter so despite the cold it wasn't too bad.  The waitress was very attentive and asked a few times if we were alright sitting right next to the cold and we appreciated her attentiveness in looking after us.",

This is earlier than I would normally be up, but since my parents are early risers, I wasn't going to argue. After my Mom looked at the menus of a couple of places that had generally positive reviews (she's allergic to milk, so we like to make sure she has plenty of choices before going somewhere, more on that later), we settled on Sunnyside.\n\nOur group of six was seated immediately upon entry, presumably due to the fact that it was still so early. It definitely got busier as time went on, although by the time we left (around 10:30), there were still some empty tables. The service was fast and friendly, and our coffee cups never sat empty for long. The food itself was delicious, and the portions were substantial - great value for the price! I ordered an omelette and I felt satisfied upon finishing it, a good sign considering my voracious appetite.\n\nWhen my Mom notified our server about her allergy, she was told that they usually cook with some type of oil/grease that contains dairy (I can't remember the name of it), but the server indicated they'd have no trouble accommodating her restriction. When our food arrived, my Mom noticed that her meal wasn't as hot as she would've liked, presumably due to the fact that the cooks prepared her plate in advance of the rest of us. I also noticed that other people, who were seated and ordered after us, received their food before we did. I'm not sure if this is considered a faux pas, but when I worked in a restaurant, we made absolutely sure to avoid doing this. If it weren't for these two minor complaints (and moreso the first one), I might have given the place 5 stars, and if I could, I'd probably rate it 4.5 rather than 4.\n\nI could definitely see myself returning, and won't hesitate to recommend this spot to anyone else!",

Third Street\n\nTL;DR - The food was delicious but the event is poorly run and needs to work out some serious kinks. \n\nPros:\n- The food was grrrreat (ribs from Atlanta FTW)\n- The live music was pleasant \n- There were tons of (empty!) bathrooms\n\nCons:\n- The check-in process. The tickets say 6-8p, but you spend about 20-30 minutes trying to get in the gate. They didn't use scanners and they let the line roll around the block with very little security and direction. Once we get to the front, they don't look at the tickets, just toss them to the side and go into how to vote for People's Choice, which is causing the huge backup in the line. Here's an idea -- Team One: SCAN THE BARCODES and get the people in the gate; Team Two: hand out the token and a quarter sheet that says \"put this in the voting box of your favorite ribs\" or tell people just that; Team Three: guest info booth inside the event for people who require additional support. \n\n- Bait and switch: nowhere did we read that you get only 5 selections. With 40+ BBQ teams out there that's ridiculous. Make the portions smaller and let people try more. It immediately skews the voting (feeling bad for the SC and GA folks in the back corner) and it's just shady. Spell it out EVERYWHERE and let guests know what to expect. \n\n- Bait and switch 2: they talk about tasting and pairing bourbon, which is almost a lie. You get two tastings (i.e., shots), nothing is \"paired\", and they ran out almost immediately. Utter nonsense. Maybe try inviting breweries next year? Beer and BBQ go well together, no? Or at least try stocking the bars correctly. \n\n- The bars were understaffed and lines were long; felt terrible for the bartenders and annoyed for all the guests.\n\n- Organization: what a waste of space. Move those teams closer to the stage and create an energy around there!! The music was almost an afterthought, which was so sad. SET UP SOME TALL PUB TABLES near the stage if nothing else. Create a social atmosphere...the spaced out floor plan just took away the fun that this should've been.\n\n- Provide napkin and wet-nap stations. It's ribs, you guys...think about your guests. Get a sponsor for it and set it up. \n\n- Where were all the people? We love food and travel often, we only stumbled upon this while doing research for our trip to Vegas. It's so sad that the turnout was so small. Market this thing and get people out to enjoy!\n\n- Lastly, $3 for the tiniest bottle of water *in life* was offensive, just saying. \n\nAll in all, this was our least favorite food festival/event from an execution standpoint, but hot damn if the food wasn't awesome. This could be epic if they figured out how to run the thing. :-/ Fingers crossed!!",

            "text" : "I returned to the World Food Championships in downtown Las Vegas, this time with Diane in tow.  At the 3rd Street Stage we saw a mouthwatering demonstration by Heather Walker on behalf of The Happy Egg Co. of how to make a Lemon Praline Genoise, the Lemon Curd of which she reported had some of its origins dating back as far as the reign of France's Louis XIV.  When I heard this I could just picture the monarch on his throne gaining more weight from indulging in a single slice of this carb--, cholesterol-, and sugar-laden cake.  When done it held in its gooey goodness 6 sticks of butter, 20 eggs, and who knows how many cups of sugar?  Sounds more like a food bomb!  But, when completed, with its lovely White Buttercream Frosting and pool of bright yellow Lemon Curd mounted on top, the dazzling dessert looked like a truly luxurious treat.  Alas, spectators did not get an opportunity to taste this sweet confection.  But for just watching the event we did receive nice-looking and useful spatulas, and plush chickens for our two granddaughters, courtesy of The Happy Egg Co.\n\nWe also sampled a cooked pork belly from another demonstration, and walked to the DLV Center where we unfortunately saw little of interest.  We probably arrived at a lull in the action.  Had we been hungry at the time we could have availed ourselves of the tempting-sounding offerings of Baby's Badass Burgers Food Truck.\n\nBut, for me, the Kenmore Kitchen Coliseum was the most happening place.  Here we watched--more like smelled--much of the culinary action occurring during the Preliminary Round of the World Seafood Championship.  The scent of chowders mixed in the air with the briny freshness of crab legs being spread like spokes on the edges of a Seafood Salad, while lovely orange slabs of salmon could be observed being cut with chef's knives prior to grilling.  And gas grills were present in abundance--all Bull outdoor grills, like the one we have in our California home, which I consider to be one of the best purchases we ever made.  We didn't get to sample any seafood either, sad to say.  But when we went directly from Fremont \nStreet to the D Grill  for dinner, we were certainly ready to dine.  \n\nUnfortunately, after a multi-year Vegas run, the World Food Championships is moving on to Florida next year.  But hopefully this culinary competition will return to Sin City soon.  And when it does, I will definitely be back to watch some of it, and smell more fresh food cooking on grills!",

            "text" : "I was really disappointed in this event. I bought the so-called V.I.F. (Very Important Foodie) pass for $275 for myself and a friend because it said it covered all but one major event. Upon arrival, none of the Information staff (volunteers) knew anything about it. I had also signed up to judge and was sent to The D Hotel, 12th Floor WFC Command Center. No one there knew anything about scanning my receipt in order to receive my passes. I expected at a minimum to be given an itinerary of events, times and places. Nope. Those were only provided to official staff. \n\nThe opening reception was ridiculous. It was held on the rooftop of the DLV and there were probably close to 1000 people there. There were lines to get to the bar for the \"free\" but awful wine, 8 oz beer in a plastic cup cost $7, mixed drinks were more. The servers were mobbed as they came into the crowd so if you weren't poised to strike as they came out, no food for you. I was able to snag a chicken stick (no satay sauce), a meat/mushroom puff, a mini-eggroll and a cocktail pig in a blanket. Wow! I did mention that this the World Food Championships we're at, right?\n\n I was told that the only judges meeting would be just before my event.  I asked exactly where and when my judging event was and was told to report to the judges tent an hour ahead of time. When I did, I was told to come back an hour later. Coming back at that time, I damn near missed my event. The judging itself was fun, albeit too brief. All the food that's prepared for the judges and is not eaten is thrown away. Can't share with anybody or bring back to your room or anything.\n\nI was asked to judge a second event, the Chili Cook-Off. Unfortunately, when I arrived to do so, they were running way behind (like 2 hours), so it was going to conflict with the judging class I had signed up for and that was part of my $275. So off to class I went. In general, it was provided to certify judges in the E.A.T. methodology that WFC uses. It's a good system, fair to contestants, and if adopted by other culinary challenges could turn out to be like the tasting rules for Kansas City BBQ cook-offs. The class however should have been given BEFORE anyone judged anything and at a time when it didn't conflict with tasting events.\n\nThere were some celebrity chef show-downs that were kind of fun to watch, and the Bourbon, Banjos and BBQ event had some great BBQ, but again, was very poorly done. Anyone could pay $5 and get the same exact thing that my $275 pass entitled me to: 5 tasting chips and a poker chip to vote on my fave. Really?\n\nDid I mention that the last 2 days are celebrity judged only? Yup. When it gets down to the top 10 in each category and the total top 10, only celebrity judges make the cut. That basically means that the last 2 full days of the event are a waste of time for the general public.\n\nIn general, this event could be truly great, but is instead pretty ho-hum except for the contestants and celebrities. Even the volunteers got more out of it than I did, a paying customer. At least the volunteers had a schedule and itinerary they could refer to, they got to try a lot of food and they had something to do all the time. If I go again I will certainly NOT buy the pass.",

I also won free admission to the Burger Extravaganza event, courtesy of Yelp.\n\nWhen I first heard about the inaugural WFC, I was immediately intrigued. It's a food competition featuring the best of the best. Categories like chili, burgers, sandwiches, and BBQ are represented. It's all American food, so it doesn't exactly represent the \"world.\" Adam Richman was the perfect host for this event, as everyone knows him from Man vs. Food.\n\nI had a great time judging food. For categories like sandwiches and burgers, the competition went through several rounds of judging. The finalists would then have their food judged by a panel of celebrities and chefs, most notably Adam Richman. As for the BBQ, I thought the samples I had were very good -- all of the BBQ teams are previous grand champions, so they brought their game.\n\nFrom my point of view, I thought that the event was reasonably organized. Something of this size with so many people and logistics involved, I'm sure this took a lot of work to set up. There were a lot of booths from sponsors set up at the front of Bally's right by the Strip, and that attracted the majority of the crowd. The stage up front was perfect to show off demos, music, and announcements. The sandwich and burger competitions were also held at the front of the hotel.\n\nHowever, the energy at the back of the Bally's hotel was dead. It was the area for the BBQ and chili competition. Maybe because it covered so much ground, but most of the time it seemed really quiet. If I was a casual foodie or passer-by, I wouldn't have known about the area, so they probably could've done a better job with putting up signs. Many of the eating and VIP experiences were very expensive -- something that the casual foodie would probably not fork over the money.\n\nPersonally, I had a great time. At the Burger Extravaganza, I got to sample multiple gourmet burgers (slider sized), along with drinks and dessert. I even got to chat with Adam for a few minutes. He's just a normal, cool guy who loves his food and BBQ. Safe to say, his shows on Travel Channel has skyrocketed him to celebrity status. It remains to be seen if they will organize this event next year. If they do, you know where I'll be!",

I also love that they have body butter in your favorite scents now.  It's much thicker than lotion and makes your skin feel really moisturized if you apply it right after you get out the shower (which can be hard from moisturizer with added fragrance).",

I might not be the biggest fan of sports, but when a tennis game or the Olympics comes on those gorgeous screens I cannot help but watch in awe. The banquette seating along the walls are comfortable and lounge worthy. After a few sets of volleyball, I was slouching down as if I was sitting on my couch.\n\nThe beers are reasonable at $4-$5 for a pint and $5-$7 for a 22oz draft. When drinking, it is hard not to snack and their pretzel bites with cheese sauce are definitely a winner. \n\nThe staff was considerate and checked in on us often. Our waiter started to slow down close to the end of his shift. It was still pleasant because we were just chilling. I liked the fact that he was not put off with us ordering a few drinks and a snack. Coming from the service industry, it can be frustrating. We were there to relax and he didn't hassle us.",

Hoping for a creative drink menu (which is what I heard) I was so disappointed..  We tried the Blueberry Lemonade.. not bad if you like super sweet and syrupy.  I don't but that was the only slightly creative drink on there. Then hoping the food would make up for it, we ordered from the menu.  Actually, we thought it was the bar menu and learned it was the actual restaurant menu.. disappointment number ?  Typical bar food.  So, expecting good bar food I ordered onion rings.  Ooops, sorry, out of onion rings.. what? They can't cut up some onions.. NO, because most likely it is a frozen bag of onion rings.  Ok, I'll try Buffalo wings.  Can't go wrong with that right? Wrong! Another frozen bag with a sad excuse for sauce and watery ranch.. it actually just tasted like milk.  My husband ordered their raw tuna concoction and said I shouldn't even try it because it seemed a bit old.. and I'm sensitive to old fish.. that's ok with me.

When we sat down the bartender was quick to reach out her hand and introduce herself, and ask our names too. Obviously, this is how they get to know everyone's name.\n\nCame in for Sunday Football.  Lots of TV's.  Accommodating bartenders with changing the channel as needed.  Lots of machines at the bar so you can gamble and watch and smoke and drink and eat if you want.  Sensory overload ... love that!\n\nPS - I saw a bartender taking shots on the DL without involving customers or anything.

In the middle of our visit a song came on that we liked, and my daughter started to whistle to it. I make fun of her for whistling all the time, and eventually we were trying to whistle to the song together but we're laughing because we couldn't finish one line of the song. Keep in mind we didn't even finish our first drink so we were not drunk at all. We then heard a comment from a bartender who hadn't talked to us since we sat down saying \"no one wants to hear you whistle..\" I thought she said something like \"we like your whistling,\" but she then said something along the lines of \"everyone wants you to stop.\" We were both a little shocked so we asked for our bill. She made another rude comment and that made me even more upset, because there was no reason for it. We then paid our bill and left, sadly I left a dollar tip because of her rude comments but our bartender was good, in fact we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere until the comments from the blonde bartender started. \n\nI can understand if whistling in a sports bar is annoying, but the way the bartender handled the situation was very catty and unprofessional. If she was to ask us to tone it down, or let us know others were complaining (which we did not get that vibe from any of the men at the bar, in fact they were laughing along with us) we would have gladly stopped. \n\nIt felt more like a catty girl moment, and it's disappointing because that was our first time trying out The Bar, and again we enjoyed everything up until the bartender was unprofessional. \n\nAlso, it's a sports bar on a Friday night during march madness...If whistling bothers you that much I hate to think what would happen if people start singing along to a song in your bar.",

I'm sorry I can't remember their names. Both very sweet and welcoming, which is unusual woman to woman. I ordered the meatloaf and it was delicious!

Their cocktail waitresses are attentive and friendly and their food is above par.\n\nSusie was the cocktail waitress taking care of me and my friends.  She was clearly aware of everything that was happening with my friends and I at all times and offered all of the right things at the right time.  If you visit many bars, then you know how fantastic that is, particularly in Vegas.  Many Vegas cocktail waitresses these days seem to have an attitude of \"I will get to you when I feel like it\" while making you wait till they remember you are there.  Susie was there before I even thought to look for her.  Not just once, not just twice, but over and over again from the moment I got there till I left.  She might be the greatest cocktail waitress I have ever witnessed, and I have visited many bars.  I can't think of a single word except perfection.  Sounds a bit over the top, I know, but I am a service junkie.  I can only dream that every bar I go to has a cocktail waitress like Susie.\n\nThis is coming from a guy who hates gaming bars.  I can't stand them.  Here though, I recieved better service than many upscale bars I attend regularly.  Notably better.\n\nIs that all?  No.  I was hungry and in the mood for spinach.  Yes spinach, I like spinach and on occasion I crave spinach.  A spinach salad at a gaming bar? \"I will just hope for the best\" I thought.  Then it came.  A perfect looking, fresh spinach salad that also had a touch of personality.  Strawberries and glazed walnuts with goat cheese and a maple vinaigrette.  I was astonished how great this salad was, and I am a tough critic with food.\n\nThe only downside to this bar is that it is very far from my home and on the complete opposite side of town.  I hope that the fundamentals that make this place great are maintained and expanded upon with success and new locations closer to me.  The only suggestion I would give is to give your bar and future bars a more unique look and feel to astetically separate them from the mess that is the mass of other gaming bars in Vegas that are no where near your level.\n\nThank you for the refreshing experience.  I wish you great success.",

Then yesterday, visions of that horrific experience resurfaced and got another episode of PTEED (Post Traumatic Eating Experience Disorder).\n\nIn all seriousness, I do feel compelled to write about how disgusting the chicken sandwich I ordered for lunch was, as it is dishonest to sell such repugnant chow. \nImagine going to the 99cents store, buy some type of boiled subpar pre-cooked rubbery chicken breast, cut is up in slices, keep some fat on it, keep it for 6 weeks and serve it cold on a baguette that looks more like a 20 days old gas station dinner roll. Well...it tasted even worse than that. You also pay $10 for the privilege of eating rancid food. \n\nThinking of it, I am not even sure it was chicken or if I was the victim of a joke or the cook quit that day. It sounds dramatic, but I can say that this had to be one of the worst eating experience, because 3 weeks later, I actually still think about it. I get borderline angry when thinking that anyone in their right mind would ever dare serve this vile sandwich. I had lunch there previously a long time ago and things were tasty then. I also had food at their other location lately and it was ok. Nothing to write home about but in all fairness, would not expect sensational food from a bar.\n\nPositive: Bartender was nice and friendly.",

At our table we had wings, boneless wings, a bbq burger, a patty melt, tater tots, fries, and nachos.  I tried most of the food and we all seemed to agree that all of it was pretty great.

It was served on what looked like a yummy French baguette. It wasn't. It was bland, tasteless and rubbery. We asked for the Catawba sauce (mayo and siracha) which turned out to be the only good tasting thing we ordered. Don't order the fish sandwich no matter what anyone says, unless you like fish McNugget sandwiches.  $42.00 for two fish sandwiches and fries that we did not finish or take home, 1 beer that my husband didn't finish drinking, water for me, fried pickles (tasted good not didn't like the breading).

It's a general, run of the mill gastropub.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  \n\nWhen you first walk in, there are NO signs that say if you have to wait to be seated or if it was seat yourself.  After waiting for 5-6 minutes, hubby and I decided to seat ourselves, when someone miraculously appeared to seat us.  The place was NOT busy, so I really don't understand what took so long.\n\nWe were seated at a tall table with chairs and our waitress promptly came by and took our drink orders.  After a few more minutes, she returned with our drinks and took our orders.  I must say, the promptness of the food would have given them 5 stars.  Within 5 minutes, we had our orders.  Hot and yummy.  I ordered the Irish Nachos because I was told that they were \"to die for.\"  I tasted them and was like, \"Meh.  I've had better.\"  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"to die for\" either.  I really have had better.  I was offered a refill on my ice tea just after the check came, so points lost of that.  While the service overall was friendly, it was not always prompt.  The place looked clean overall, but I didn't get a chance to visit the restrooms.  While there are TV's everywhere, the rest of the decor was sparse.   The big windows bring lots of light to a very dark place, so I'd hate to see how dark it really is in the evening.\n\nWhile I won't write them off, I certainly won't promote them either.   Are they kid friendly.  I would not bring my kids here in the evening.  Yes, for lunch in the middle of the day, but definitely NOT in the evening or dinner.  Yeah....

It's one of those sports bar/restaurant places with \"industrial\" ceilings that make it super loud to begin with. But add a packed house, several televisions and loud music and you can't hear yourself think, let alone talk to your table mates. I expected this and it didn't bother me at first but my 22 year old son (who frequents BW3's which is also loud) said he wouldn't go back because of it. \n\nWe ordered the spinach dip to start. Unfortunately--perhaps because it was so loud--the waitress heard chicken tenders. A man came over with the chicken later and we had to send him away TWICE after we informed him we ordered the spinach dip. The waitress came back and asked if we wanted the chicken and we told her--again--we ordered the spinach dip. She said would fix it and she did. The dip came fairly quick after that. But, we barely took one bite before our entrees descended on us. This annoys me because an appetizer is not supposed to be served with the entree and there was no room for 5 large plates and 4 small ones on the pub-style table. However, the dip was quite good. We all agreed.\n\nMy son ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. I could see immediately that the chicken was, albeit large, very saturated with oil. He ate it and said it was ok, but refused to eat the fries for the same reason. He tried doctoring them up and still couldn't eat them. They were oily and limp. \n\nHis friend had the rack of ribs. It was $17-ish, I think he said, and not worth it at all. According to him, it was about 20% fat and not tasty. However, this boy eats about 4 things total and is very picky so I'm not sure how accurate that assessment is. He also agreed his fries were very oily but those are one of his staple foods and he ate them.\n\nMy son's other friend had a sandwich of some kind, which he devoured. He also said the fries were super greasy, but his mother doesn't let him eat a lot of greasy foods so he thought it was great. LOL. \n\nI ordered a Cuban sandwich and I really liked it. However, half way through eating my (oily) fries...I realized I had ordered the Kettle chips. So, our order was wrong again. I figured I already ate half of them so I didn't complain.\n\nGetting out of there was fairly speedy. We all considered not tipping (or not tipping much) but I personally having worked for tips in the past couldn't bring myself to punish the waitress for the crappy work of the cooks or the fact that she couldn't hear a damn thing in there. She should have accounted for this and refused to serve bad food or double checked what we wanted, though.\n\nI guess I would give the place another try if someone wanted to, but wouldn't suggest it.",

Great place to stock up on BBQ sauce, coffee, tortilla chips, A-1, charcoal for smoking and grilling, and a few other items.

I tried to say something about this being the special 6 quid guide, not the bi-weekly etc... \"I know, we don't allow people looking through it\".  Now I understand he probably has people run in, check a listing in the bi-weekly and then leave without buying it, but I am not going to spend 6 pounds on a magazine without at flipping through it.\n \"Fine, we'll buy it somewhere else\" says I, as I put it back on the shelf.  He was even so rude as to tell us to \"try the library next time\".

I order a turkey sandwich with a egg fried hard and strawberry pancake puppies.When we got our food I seen the egg was running out of the my sandwich and the turkey was ice cold.

She said she cooked my sandwich and when I explained that the same yolk soaked bread was used she denied. she was very unfriendly and unapologetic about the situation.

When we ordered, my mother stated to the waitress that she wanted the Veggie Omelet without mushrooms, as she has an allergy to mushrooms.  When the food came out, she was a few bites in and discovered a mushroom.  I immediately called the waitress over.  She apologized and took the omelet back.  She brought out another, but roughly half way though, my mother stated that she needed to leave and get Benadryl into her system for her allergy, as her reaction was starting.  \n\nI took the bill up and made mention to the cashier that I didn't feel as though we should be charged full price for that item, as the staff had caused the problem themselves.  She got the manager.  The manager then came up very rudely and very coldly and stated that if she was going to have a reaction, she shouldn't have taken the second omelet.  Seriously?  He didn't offer a discount, a voucher.  He didn't offer an apology!?!?  He just asked, quite rudely, that we pay and leave.  That man should not be working in customer service.  If my mother's reaction worsens to the point that she needs medical care, that store could be liable.  And to offer no remorse?  Crazy.\n\nAll of this was after waiting 20 minutes to place an order, waiting five minutes for the manager to be able to break away from whatever else he was doing to come talk to me.

Ok so it was time to order the waitress was friendly and was training another waiter in the progress. We didn't mind. My boyfriend requested a drink on the menu that wasn't there and she attempted to make it. He liked it lol.. So we ordered nachos and she told us there weren't any beef for the nacho so I requested chicken. She said \"sure I can do that\" she finished with the order and went to the back. Ok so here were it went south. The chef/cook cussed out our waitress and threatened her life. It sounded  like a fight would've started any minute. She (the cook) started dropping f bombs and just been hateful towards our waitress. Our waitress came back and told us that the manger would cook the food. I asked her what happened. And she had let us know that because we requested chicken the cook got pissed. I asked will there be any action because she threaten your life. The waitress said no because she is very loved here. So after that, the cook left to go home early and we paid and tipped generously. Believe that I will never return. The waitress was great but that cook just rubbed me the wrong way!!!",

We walk in and there's two tables of four, a table of three, and a table of two in this huge Denny's, basically they were empty. So, we greeted our friends waiting for us with hugs all around. Seconds after we sat down our waitress comes over and asks us to, \"keep it down, the other customers are looking at us and the manager asked for us to keep it down because we were being loud.\" \n\nAnd sidenote - this little waitress with dyed red hair was not the nicest gal either. Not sure what her issue was, but she was feeling some type of way about her life last night. And that's not a diss at the staff cause 90% are some super cool people that love to chat, especially cause it's slow on business. I've had some awesome servers at this Denny's but she was not even trying to be nice. Also, the cooks are awesome and do a wonderful job!!!\n\nSo, after we were hushed by the waitress, I was over it, but would stay if the majority wanted to stay. She asked for our drink order and I asked for a water and a hot chocolate. And naturally they didn't have hot chocolate... What? Who doesn't have hot chocolate in the winter? And why do you always run out of stuff and are never busy? At this point, I'm not even going to order anything. \n\nWe looked at the menu's for a brief moment and decided not to stay because we did not feel welcome. It would be different if the waitress waited 5 minutes to see if we were actually going to be that loud or if the manager Darryl came over and said something himself, but the mood was off and it's not right to patron establishments that really don't want you there. \n\nMessage to the Manager Darryl: Looks like last night 11/23/2015 was a rough night. Brianne H. left a message about how her service was terrible and things were just rough. It is unprofessional to be upset from a prior incident and take it out on other customers. It is bad business to always be out of stuff. It is bad business to have people that come in regularly and not know their names or have any investment in them. I have been in pretty regularly since September and know tons about you and your moods from multiple servers and customers, yet have never met you or had any interaction with you because you don't talk to customers. I literally just told someone this past weekend that the service and things had changed at this Denny's, but I'm gonna call and tell them differently.",

I was told it would be 15 minutes and I said that would be fine. I ended up getting to Denny's exactly 20 minutes after ordering and was told that the order was not ready yet. I waited a few more minutes until the order was ready (not really a big deal at this point) and I left without checking the food so I could be at work on time. When I got to work and started to unbox my Slamwich, I noticed that it was really french toast, bacon, and eggs instead. I called Denny's and told them about the mix up. The manager told me that I have two options at this point. The first option was to come back to the Denny's and get a new Slamwich. This was out of the question because I work in Cleveland Heights. The other option was for the manager to take my name and number and I could order a Slamwich at a later date with no charge. I accepted option number two and I figured I would just order from Denny's again when I had another craving for it. Fast forward to this morning, I had another craving for Denny's so I figured I would order my free Slamwich and bring it to work. When I called I got one of the other managers on the phone and explained to them the situation I have just explained above. I was told that without anything in writing I would not be able to redeem a free Slamwich. So not only did I not get my money back for the wrong order, I didn't even get my food replaced with the correct food. I would strongly suggest anyone considering going to this Denny's to reconsider.

Basically in the mid afternoon, usually after 3pm to about 5-6 pm, they have a couple of dishes priced a little cheaper than normal and they offer a free drink as well.  \n\nI love coming here for afternoon tea.  They have a lot things to choose from, much more than most other places.  The prices are great too.  The free drink is nice.  I always get a cold HK milk tea.  Usually, you're charged extra for a cold drink.  This is standard practice actually but Keung Kee does it for free!  Another bonus!!  YAY!!\n\nI loved the baked rice dishes. You choose a sauce,  and a choice of protien (pork, chicken, fish etc.)  The portions are big so you always leave full. \n\nSo if you ever wake up too late on a weekend and you feel like something that can last you to dinner, think about giving Keung Kee a try.  This is my go to place on Saturdays when I sleep in.  The service can get slow when they're busy, which they can get on weekends, but nothing that will disappoint you.",

However, the dishes do not come close to beating Congee Wong's for the quality and price. \n\nCame with my family on a weekend and we were immediately seated by the friendly staff. I'd like to note that they were all very attentive and engaging, which was not the usual for Chinese restaurants but hey, I'm not complaining. \n\nWe ordered several dishes, from the large soup to the fried noodles, fried rice with eel, and beef tendon.\n\nAll the dishes were good, standard Chinese dishes. I would say the portions are much smaller than that of Congee Wong's and slightly more expensive. The taste was a bit more bland, not as flavorful as I would of hoped. \n\nThe service is something to note, it's actually really good here! However, I will probably just head do Congee Wong when my next craving for Chinese food hits me based on the quality, portions, and price. \n\nIf you are to stop by, I highly recommend any of the fried noodle dishes - that was one I thought they did really well and the portions were on par.",

Soup seemed like it was boiled with pork bones first until it gave off a white tint with vegetables being added later on as to keep it fresh. Can easily feed 4 people, so bring friends. This dish goes well with any other dishes here.\n\n2nd Dish : Satay beef with vermicelli hot pot\n\nStandard dish, with nice presentation in an actual ceramic pot. There is ample vermicelli but just a little lacking in beef. Taste wise, the satay sauce really works with the meat, but be warned you will get thirsty afterwards. \n\nPortion size was generally good for both dishes. \n\nStaff/Service Rating - 3.5 / 5\nGiven the low crowd level, service staff were able to seat us quickly and provide adequate attention when customers request refills/order/check. \n\nStaff did not seem enthusiastic but we're fine in meeting the needs of customer. \n\nEnvironment Rating - 3 / 5\nService areas for customers are kept mostly clean. Floors could use some mopping but tables are clean when customers sit down. Rear sanitary facilities could use some work and washrooms look like they could use some maintenance. Poor lighting in washrooms also detract from their environment score. \n\nPrice Rating - 3 / 5\nPrice after tax and 12% tip - $40.34. Fair pricing given soup portion size. However, the satay beef and vermicelli bowl could have been a little cheaper. \n\nOther notes - we saw other people get an additional soup and dessert which appeared complimentary, but we never got it #Sadface. So not sure if it's based on what meals you order.",

I'd give the other location 3.5 stars but only 2 here before the food wasn't as good in comparison.\n\nEnvironment:\nThere are 3 big plazas at the Finch/Midland intersection, and Keung Kee is located at the 3rd plaza north of the intersection. The parking space is rather tight but there are a few extra spaces at the back of the plaza if you don't mind walking a little bit more. \nThe restaurant is pretty big with many large round tables in the middle, that can fit groups of 6-10. The decor are really pretty as well and the space was bright and clean. I was here for weekday dinner and the restaurant was quite empty, with only customers sitting on the smaller tables at the edges. \n\nFood:\nWe ordered BBQ Pork, Pork Belly with Taro in Casserole, Minced Pork with Noodles, and Pork Bone Congee. \nThe BBQ Pork is always my go-to dish at this restaurant because the flavour is amazing and the meat is very soft. It did not disappoint. \nThe Pork Belly with Taro was also a great dish as well, if you don't mind eating some fat. Personally, I think the fat is absolutely the best part of the dish because it just melts in your mouth and it didn't feel greasy at all. \nMinced Pork with Noodles was pretty average and the portion was smaller than I expected. Not a great dish to get from their noodles section.\nThe Pork Bone Congee had great flavour, but it's not something that I would have liked in a congee dish. The congee had a really strong black pepper taste which I thought was too over-powering, as congee dishes tend to be pretty light in terms of flavour. Also, given that the restaurant's full Chinese name 强记鸡粥 includes the word \"congee\" in it, I was expecting a lot more from this dish. \nFor dessert, we each received a small bowl of sweet tofu. The tofu was very soft and I liked the slight ginger taste in the syrup. \n\nService:\nNon-existent service. Had to call them many times to get our request across. Even though the restaurant was only like half full they still seemed to be understaffed, so the waiters were always busy and on the go. \n\nThe bill ended up being $45 after tax for the 3 of us, which wasn't really that bad come to think of it.

Plain rice noodle is one of their specialties, and as always, it was well done. I love how they serve it with skewers.

Went at 8:00pm on a wednesday, restataurant was 60% empty and they had 3 waiters that have a very unique skill of walking around without looking at you.  Sort of like AYCE Japanese restaurant.  Had to wait 15~20min before we could flag down a retarded fat ass lazy waiter.\n\nSince i don't speak cantonese, i was ordering in english and he would yell out loud the dish i wanted in Cantonese....in a signing tone...WTF???\n\nWhen he brought over the #2) dish, he spilled half of it on his hand, table and chair beside me...no big deal.  BUT ATLEAST CLEAN IT UP!!!.  When he brought over the #1) and #3) i asked him each time to clean that up, he just rolled his eyes.  I finally had to flag down ANOTHER WAITER (which was a challenge itself) to clean it up. \n\nAnyways, bill came up to $30ish+, left him $0.01 tips.\n\nP.S.

The waitress told us the cooks were being lazy because of a previous rush of deliveries. She also told us that the owners put far more weight into the deleveries than they do those who are dinning in and waiting. This seems backwards. If I have to wait on something I would rather be in the comfort of my own home.  We had gotten up and put our coats on when the food finally arrived.\nOur waitress was far too forthcoming with the issues with the restaurant and the owners. We know that the owners are great with Italian food because they're from Egypt... Wait... What? I don't think that waitress works there anymore.\n\nNow the conundrum of the food:\nThe lazagne was interesting. It had way too much liquid in it and I was ready for a horrible meal. I was surprised at the outstanding flavor though. I was ready for the very tasting looking garlic knots. Again, looks are deceiving. They were obviously bought in a can or the freezer section and they were over cooked. I couldn't even eat one. The waitress said that the good bread sells out early so they then bake this other stuff. Personally, I think they just go next door to food lion and grab it out of the freezer. \nMy wife got the philly cheese steak, which was awesome. It came with fries, which were horrible. I am sure they are frozen. \n\nThey have a large selction (although quite a few typos on the menu)\nThey need to reduce the amount on the menu, fix the side items, and pay a little more attention to the people seated in the restaurant.\n\nOur solution:\nWhat we do now is call ahead to get philly cheese steaks (it takes about 20 minutes for them to be ready) and go pick it up.

Then they booked me the next day so I wouldn't have to wait for treatment.

And Ronnie, the Technician is just a treasure.  \n\nHe gave me such awesome service that I stopped him from working 3 times to ask him if he was doing extra stuff I would have to pay for later on.  He assured me the price was the same as quoted by the office. \n\n I was so surprised because in all the years I used the other company, even though they had come to recognize me by voice over the years, they never went to such lengths to get my carpet cleaned without pointing out each spot and quoting me the additional cost of removing each one.\n\nWith Dial, I got one price quote.  I paid the price that was quoted.  I got a full house of clean carpet.  My carpet looks almost brand new.  For the first time in 13 years I enjoy walking barefoot on my carpet because whatever they used made it feel so soft and smell so fresh.  \n\nI sent them a set of before and after pictures for their website.  I don't know if they will actually post them or not, but if they do mine are the black and white images.  :-)\n\nI would definitely recommend this company to everyone.  It would be very difficult to find a carpet cleaning company that's better than Dial.",

They worked hand in hand with our insurance company and saved us a ton on our deductible. The workers they sent were also so helpful. They called me down to show me (as we were concerned) the moisture readings to put us at ease that the job was done. They also took heavy precautions with the installation of the floors and baseboards because whichever company did it prior actually caused the leak we had in the first place.

So with no aggressive price match offer I walk away and keep looking. As I walk into the clearance section I spotted shoes I liked with a fair price of $60 bucks for the taking. I immediately started taking my shoes off and getting the Nikes I ready. During that time the manager came around the corner very swiftly and stopped about a foot maybe two feet from me. Then asks, \"so what kind of deals are you looking for today?\"(I had already asked her what deals they had when I walked in and she replied, \"what you see is what you get.\".) I said,\"Any good deals would be nice.\".. This lady then has the nerve to say,\"Yeah we'd all like that now wouldn't we.... So what kinda shoes were you looking for today?\"... She literally asked me what kinda of shoes I was looking for as I was getting those Nikes ready to put on my foot..... Seriously??? You really didn't notice the shoes I had in my hand? So I tell her,\"you know I'll be good and really don't need any assistance, I can handle this.\" So she walks away.. 30 seconds later the other employee, who was also training a new employee on something in the front comes over and starts talking about the shoes in the clearance section 4 feet from me. I thought to myself,\"you gotta be kidding, this lady thinks I'm about to run off with these.\" So I grabbed the shoes put them in the box and walked to the register, seeing the training materials on the counter where the other employees left off due to them coming over and standing by me.\nThe lady starts talking and I interrupt with, \"does it look like I'm going to steal? Do I really look like someone who's going to steal from you?\" And the lady(mind you she's the manager) says while shrugging her shoulders,\" well, I gotta take care of my store?\" I looked at her with disbelief and replied,\"you just lost a sale and a customer.\" and walked out of the store leaving without the shoes I wanted.. \nI'm a hard working individual and I pay my fair share of taxes and remain a kinda caring person with moral and ethical values.

Additional flavorings such as cilantro, paprika, cumin, thyme, lemon, and bay leaf. What we received was a small dish of chopped onion in water...no green anything. Very disappointed. The fried Tostones were very thin and crisp..I liked them but not enough to make me go back to Pio Pio...I will just get a chicken at Costco or Harry Teets if I am craving Rotisserie Chicken again...Sorry Pio Pio..you did not make my list!",

Horrible service.  \n\nI have been here many times with no major issues.... until I tried to use a Groupon voucher.  The server absolutely refused to accept the voucher without it being printed out.  He insisted that the rules on the voucher stated that it had to be printed out.  This was not the case nor does it make any sense.  I was not about to waste the money that I had spent on the voucher so a couple of weeks later I called in an order for takeout that I planned to use the Groupon for. I had no desire to dine in there again.  This time I had it printed out. Upon arrival the same server berated me, telling me that he was a part owner and that if I didn't want to follow the rules that I shouldn't come back.  I slid the printout across the bar as asked him to show me where it stated that I needed to have the certificate printed.  He, of course, could find no mention of this and insisted that this was not a certificate from the same company that I had tried to use the prior time that I had been there.  Yeah, because I'm going to buy more vouchers to a restaurant that treats its customers this poorly.  He was simply dead wrong but refused to admit it.  \n\nThe rudeness was unacceptable.

The food came out in family style and the portions were very large. Surprisingly we had left overs and we were all stuffed! I recommend the combos because of the variety of food you get to try. \n\nThe restaurant was smaller inside that I was anticipating but had a cozy feel.

But their chicken is in a class all of its own - it's moist, tender, and delicious!  \n\nWe have tried two appetizers so far - the guacamole and tostones (thinly sliced fried plantains), and the chicken and beef patties.  You get a hefty serving of guacamole and six large tostones.  This appetizer was filling and delicious.  The meat patties are filled with ground beef or shredded chicken, rice, and potatoes.  They are small, but spicy and delicious - especially with the sauces!  \n\nFor our entrees, I have tried the #1 - 1/4 white meat chicken and #12 tilapia.  Like I said before, the chicken is very good.  The sides are also tasty and go well with the chicken.  The buttery rice was my favorite.  (I do wish, however, that the yuca were sliced smaller and were a little crispier.)  Topped with a tomato salsa, their tilapia is crispy and really good with the white sauce. \n\nMy hubby has tried the chicken as well, and also #21 skirt steak. I'm usually NOT a fan of steak, but this was very thinly sliced, tender, and juicy.  The chimichurri sauce was a great complement to the steak.\n\nI cannot neglect to mention the sauces.  You get two sauces with your meal - a spicy green sauce and a lemony white sauce.  I loved both of them, and used them with the tostones and chicken.\n\nWhile we usually didn't need dessert, we had to try their tres leche cake at least once.  They gave us a slice large enough for sharing, and we thought it was quite good.\n\nService is fast, friendly, and efficient.  I appreciated how quickly they cleared off tables when people left so the restaurant appeared clean and welcoming.  \n\nPio Pio is a definite keeper for us!",

The service was attentive, prompt, and friendly. The atmosphere is basic. On to the food reviews:\n* Green and white table sauces: The green has a nice kick to it. The white is somewhat tangier. You could mix them together or enjoy them each separately. They're darn good, but I wouldn't say you would drink them by the ounce (i.e. they seemed to be slightly overhyped based on what I was told by my friend).\n* Arepa: 3.5 stars. Pretty standard, average stuff. No seared flavor, it is merely a vessel.\n* Tostones: 3.5 stars. Same as above. They lose heat quickly and end up a bit hard.\n* Sweet plantains: 5 stars. They have a delicious sugary burnt crisp to the edge, unlike most places where they end up mushy. Definitely order this as one of your sides.\n* Rice: 4 stars. It's rice. It's nice rice.\n* Pork skin: 4+ stars. Nothing outstanding, but it's done right. Maybe a little on the smallish side. Pork skins are always at least 4 stars when done right.\n* Chicken soup: 4.5 stars. You may want to add salt, but be sure not to overwhelm the subtle spices that lend the broth an extraordinary flavor. I did find it slightly bland, but I'm not deducting any stars for a restaurant that chooses to let you salt to taste instead of deciding how much sodium you need.\n* Side salad: *shrug* It's a salad. It's got decent size to it, but it is what it is.\n\nGood stuff, and a change from the usual.

Since I reserve that tag for the chicken at The Roasting Company on Montford Dr., I was intrigued.\n\nDanielle and I dined at Pio Pio last night after a failed attempt to go to Sir Edmund Halley's on St. Patty's Day for fish & chips.  We couldn't even get close to the place!\n\nWe both had rotisserie chicken with salad and French fries.  I really wish I had ordered the rice and beans instead of fries... it would have made me feel a little less \"gringo.\"  Everything we had was really good... although in my opinion the Roasting Company still has more flavorful chicken.  I can taste the citrus marinade on the Roasting Company's chicken, but not so much on Pio Pio's. \n\nRather than the salsa bar at RC, Pio Pio serves two sauces on the table when you are seated.  One is a white garlic sauce (which serves double-duty as an excellent salad dressing), and the other a light green jalapeno sauce.  The sauces are kind of creamy, but I believe they are non-dairy... probably an oil and vinegar emulsion.\n\nWhere Pio Pio really shines over the Roasting Company is in the dining experience.  I almost never dine in at RC, because I find the dining room to be uncomfortable and unwelcoming.  This is in stark contrast to Pio Pio where the dining room is warm and cozy.  I especially like the masonry work on the bar and the back wall.  Great ambiance for what is essentially a storefront location.\n\nThe service at Pio Pio was also excellent.  Rather than walk-up, place your order and wait for your number to be called, Pio Pio is a sit down experience at a nice covered table with friendly and accommodating wait service.\n\nMy bottom line:  If you're looking for the best take-out rotisserie chicken, I'd still got with RC.

The chicken was unbelievably moist as well as stupendously delicious. The saffron rice was delicious also as were the beans. It's been more than 30 years since I've had plantains, and I was delighted that they were as wonderful as I remembered. \n\nThe service was very pleasant, but a bit slow. I'm not sure if it was possibly a language \"thing\" or not. Anyway, they were exceptionally courteous as well as extremely Beautiful.\n\nAt first glance, the restaurant appeared to be very clean. Upon further inspection into the ladies room, I discovered just how clean the restaurant really is. They definitely deserve their \"A\" rating. \n\nAs we were leaving the restaurant, dinner was delivered to another table. They were having the red snapper, and it looks so amazing that we decided that will be what we order on our next visit. Can't wait to go back.",

I got 1/4 rotisserie chicken and hubby got the grilled chicken breast. The meat was really tender and flavorful. The spicy green chillie sauce and the garlic sauce given on the side were amazing! I agree with Albert though...they are a bit on the pricier end for the amount food you get. If you want more sauce you have to pay extra which is really annoying. \nThe service was polite and quick.

The food, the prices and the service were all excellent.\n\nHaving lived in South Florida for over 20 years before moving to North Carolina, I miss the great Latin food you can get in Miami and many other nooks and cranny's in that area. Charlotte has its own treasure trove of ethnic restaurants, you just have to know where to find them and boy is Pio Pio a find. \n\nThey're most known for their rotisserie chicken, but their steak and chicharones are even better, in my opinion. But, the real killer app at Pio Pio is their sauce. Sauces, I should say. The white sauce is a garlic sauce that is so full of flavor I could eat it on just about anything and it works great as salad dressing. The green sauce is spicy and is awesome combined with the white sauce. It tastes like a tomatillo sauce with a serious kick. To steal Emeril's line, these sauces would taste good on a car bumper.\n\nIf you're not sure what to try, get the Montanero platter. For just under 15 bucks you get rice, beans, ripe plantains, steak, egg, pork, skin (i.e. chicharones, and really good ones at that), sausage, avocado & corn cake. The corn cake (areppa) is very bland, but that's not unusual. Everything else is delicious and it's definitely enough for two. I've split it with my mom before and still had leftovers to take home. I also highly recommend the tostones (crispy fried plantains).\n\nI travel about a half hour to get to Pio Pio and every time it's worth the drive.

The table next to us got their food right as we were sitting down and I think I made it awkward moment b/c I just kept starting at this chicken all lustfully and stuff. I guess it could be considered creepy the way I was eyeing their food but whatev. My staring was a compliment.\n\nThird thing I noticed-the menu and prices. I like that the menu wasn't dish overload with too many things that sound delicious. I hate when that happens because I usually pick something random in the end since I feel pressured to order. The prices were way more reasonable then I thought they would be. Many dinners for under ten bones that come with rice and plantains. Sign me up,\n\nFour thing I noticed--the taste of the food. I got the quarter chicken with rice, beans and plantains.The chicken was all that and a bag of chips! It was moist, flavorful and juicy. They also brought out a white garlic sauce that looked similar to tsaziki sauce along with a green jalapeno sauce that had my eyes watering. Both were equally fantastic on the chicken and on top of the rice. The rice wasn't anything to write home about taste wise but the plantains were as good as I expected---I miss having plantains that taste like they should! South Florida would be proud of you Pio Pio!\n\nFifth thing I noticed---lighting fast and friendly service. Sometimes places take forever once you hand them a coupon and our waiter had it back within two minutes.\n\nSixth thing I noticed-how fun saying Pio Pio over and over again is!\n\nSeventh thing I noticed-how long this review was--oopsie\n\nAll in all, a terrific place and wallet friendly.

Lots of lunch combos to choose from, mostly revolving around a 1/4 of chicken, chicken breast, pork chops, and possibly fish.. but the combinations seemed endless.\n\nI have to say I was really surprised by the portion of rice, I couldn't finish it. The menu states it is a mix of vegetables and chicken and that it was, a very colourful and tasty blend of peas, corn, carrots, sausage, chicken, (i think that's about right) in rice with a few pieces of yucca. Lots of flavour and perfect consistency. (the yucca was, well, fried yucca. nothing spectacular)\nMy friend's soup was delicious, though we both thought the section of corn still on the cob was a little odd to be served in the bowl, and some of the chicken pieces were a little large. The rotisserie chicken was moist and flavourful.\n\nI'm not sure what the two sauces were on the table, my friend insisted the white one was what was also on his salad, but I was all about the green one. Kind of a green chili cream/mayo sauce? Whatever the ingredients, it had a nice little kick to it.\n\nThe staff was very helpful, and even though the space is small wasn't very crowded for lunch (maybe 1/3 full) There was a bit of a lag between us finishing  our meal and having the plates cleared/receiving the check, maybe because we weren't dressed in suits they assumed we weren't on a lunch break, but it was overall a minor infraction towards the whole meal. \n\nMaybe not the \"best chicken in town\" like their sign says, but a very good meal and nice portions for a low price (each lunch was under $10).

I always get the salad which has a good portion of avocado and has a really yummy dressing along with shaved carrots and cabbage! The tostones and plantains are also really good. Their sangria is tastey, however I had a hard time drinking it with all the diced apples and ice floating around in the glass. Maybe I'm just an amateur. \n\nAh... living so close to Pio Pio may be dangerous!",

The Ballantyne location did the catering, but we had our first date at the Pio Pio on East because it was my husband's favorite restaurant and it quickly became my favorite!  The food is delicious, best rotisserie chicken I have ever had, along with the chaufa rice and salad, not to mention the sauces!  They were punctual, professional and Ceasar personally delivered and helped setup the food.  My husband and I and our guests loved it and were so happy with everything!  Ceasar was great and I believe it was Ruby who worked with me us in placing the order.  We try to eat there a few times a month, we are customers for life!",

The yuca was far from fresh and it was not soft and it even had a little of a bitter taste to it, which usually means that  it is not fresh. Rice and beans were ok but nothing outstanding. \nI think someone that has never tried any kind of Latin American food might like it since they don't have anything to compare it against with.

I choose the plantains and Ted went with the yucca for our sides. The chicken was ok but as others have noted, seemed like it was microwaved -- literally SMOKING hot and pretty tough/dry. The rice and beans, also smoking hot, were probably the best thing on the plate. My plantains were good but cold. Ted's yucca were also cold and slightly stale. \n\nThey only offer 2 sauces -- a white sauce (it's ranch, right?) and a green sauce.

I signed the receipt and remember I signed it off as an even $30 (including tip). While reviewing my a/c statement yesterday I noticed I was charged 31.52. This made no sense to me and I was quite honestly surprised. Wanting to let them  know (of human error, ignorance or foul play) I called the restaurant and asked to speak with the manager. I was told he wasn't available. I told the woman on the phone (who was really sweet and appreciative of my call) what had happened and left a message for the Manager to call me back. It's been over 24 hours and I haven't received a call yet. \nLong story short- I feel cheated. A dollar fifty doesn't matter, it's about honesty and integrity. Signed receipts being manipulated (erroneously or on purpose) is appalling and I'm sure illegal. \nGave them 2 stars- for the hundreds of meals I've eaten here and because I don't think everyone deserves to be blamed for what is (hopefully) one person's error.",

The generously sized chicken was moist and succulent. The yucca, beans and rice were all delicious, especially when accompanied by their creamy dipping sauces (the green one is quite spicy). My favorite way to finish a Peruvian meal is with sweet plantains, and Pio Pio's were perfect. Nicely caramelized on the outside and soft on the inside.

If you've never been you definitely need to get the chicken on your first trip.

The ripe plantains and tostones are excellent as well. And the chicken is deliciously roasted and the skin is nice and crispy. The side sauces they bring To the table with your meal are the perfect accompniant: ones has a slow burn spiciness and the other is mild for those who don't like spicy (as a tip, they make great dipping sauces for your plantains and tostones).\n\nOn my most recent visit we went for lunch, so unfortunately no wine or sangria was involved. I ordered the salad for a bit lighter option, with a side of tostones (obvi). The salad was fresh and delicious and I basically hit the avocado jackpot (I think there was a whole sliced avocado on my salad). My salad was made complete with a generous helping of shredded chicken on top. The tostones were crispy and satisfying.\n\nI would not go her all the time because I would probably order chicken in some variety, but when I have a craving for well made chicken and rice, this is my spot.",

Nothing at all like the beans and rice you may be accustomed to at Mexican restaurants (this is Peruvian food after all!). Seasoned stewed black beans with flavorful yellow rice that were obviously made in-house with pride. I could be happy with a meal of just these. Best beans and rice I've had in recent memory! \n\nChicken: No messing around here. You get a whole darn chicken rotisserieed to juicy perfection with just enough Peruvian spice to hold your attention and coming back for more.\n\nSauces: This really shifted the chicken from 'yummy' to 'hot dang'. Near the beginning of the meal two mystery sauces appear on the table. The white one is a creamy garlic sauce. I am gonna write to Crest to request this as a new flavor of toothpaste because I was challenged to find something in the meal that wasn't enhanced by it. The orangish sauce is jalapeno-based and I used a bit more sparingly, but was just fantastic (although perhaps not toothpaste-worthy).\n\nFried Plantains: Let these cool down a bit before eating; they absorb heat well enough to buffer spacecraft from re-entry into the atmosphere. Upon their cool-down, the fried, soft, sweetness of these plantains offered a nice contrast to the rest of the spicy and saucy meal. Although probably not intended to be, I was satisfied with these as a dessert.\n\nYucca Fires: whereas not bad at all, wasn't anything super-special in my opinion. Seemed rather close to steak-cut fries to me. Go for the tostones instead!\n\nTostones: we ordered these on the side, and were grateful for that. Akin to those fried banana chips you find in trail mix, tostones are mashed and fried plantains to a crispy-yet-chewy chip-like consistency. Great by themselves, awesome dipped in one of the aforementioned sauces, and fantastic when use as a shovel for beans, rice, chicken, and sauce. You will not be disappointed!",

            "text" : "PIO PIO! Fun to say. \n\nOk I'll get this straight from the start: If you go here and you are vegetarian, don't expect a smorgasbord of options. Expect exactly 0 options, unless you modify something. They have 1 thing on the menu you can easily order (the #2) and you have to change out the chicken soup for salad. Or you can order all sides, but they are each about $4 so it adds up quick for a few veggies. \n\nThat said: My salad was delicious and thoughtful, with a nice home made creamy dressing and everything chopped and lovely, not a cheap iceburg lettuce salad a lot of places throw your way. (side note: it was stuffed into a small bowl overflowing, which is fine, but that always gives me anxiety because you have to be careful not to look like a pig spilling salad out of a tiny bowl onto your table, and I'm a pig who spills things all the time so this is a touch-n-go mix for me, give me a big plate!). \n\nThe plantains were DELICIOUS. Holy bejesus. Fried to a light crisp and so fresh and sweet! I actually had MORE plantains than I could eat. I didn't think that was possible. \n\nBeyond that they served me a fresh avocado half, and some tasty rice. The rice was a bit plain but they had a spicy buttery sauce that I mixed in and it jacked it up nicely. It was a very healthy lunch and well prepared. \n\nA bit pricy for lunch, since I forked up $11 after tip, but ok on occasion to do that.",

Their chicken is fairly good, but I've had cheaper and better chicken before.  Their plantains are also delicious; lightly sweet and flavorful.  The best of the sides is definitely the rice and beans.  However, the yucca is just ok; it's like a thicker potato in texture, and kind of stringy.  The arepas are bland and quite disappointing.  \n\nTheir lunch specials range from around $9-14, which I think is a little pricey for chicken and sides.  At dinner time, you can get a whole chicken, or you can also get a meal with sides.  The chicken alone is $10, or you can get a chicken combo for $25-35.

But word on the street was that Pio Pio was the place to pack in the poultry, and when a Groupon-esque deal came my way I just had to take advantage and see what the cluck everyone was talking about.\n\nPio Pio is hidden within a strip mall area, and not exactly the most likely place to find good eats. Don't let the location fool you...they are serving up fantastic food in that place! I like rotisserie chicken, be it from home, from Harris Teeter...heck, I'll even praise Boston Market! Yet the chicken at Pio Pio beats them all. We each got a 1/4 chicken combo and it was some of the best chicken I've ever had out. The chicken is succulent, moist, juicy, tender...basically cooked to perfection. The skin was an excellent, sinful indulgence that was too good to pass up. A combination of cooking technique and spices made this meal as good as it was. Here's a hint: let your server know if you prefer light or dark. Our server didn't ask and ended up placing a plate of dark meat in front of me and white meat in front of the miss'. Neither of us complained since that is what we would have ordered regardless, but I found it odd that they give different types of meat to customers without asking for preferences. \n\nNot only is the chicken great but the sides were pretty banging too. Ever since moving to the area I've been relatively disappointed with the rice and beans at most of the Mexican restaurants. I was shocked to find that best I've had wasn't at a typical Mexican joint but at Pio Pio. The rice is cooked PERFECTLY, with the right flavor and, more importantly (to me), the right texture. The beans are not refried mush, but actual beans in a gravy. A helpful hint is to pour those bad boys right into the rice, and you have yourself one heck of a side dish. \n\nThe combo meal came with the chicken, rice, beans, and a choice of side. I chose to go with the yucca since I've never had it before, and I was glad I took the adventurous road. They fry the yucca like a french fry, but it's a thick brick instead of a little shoestring. The taste and texture is similar to a fry, but there's more substance to it, making it more filling. The miss' went with the plantains and they were down right tastetacular. Hot, sweet, carmelized plantains don't get much better than this. While I did enjoy the yucca, I would say the plantains are the way to go.\n\nThe chicken portion is slightly skimpy, but they fill you up with heaping helpings of sides. If you are a  connoisseur  of the poultry arts I highly recommend checking this place out. Great food and definitely worth the price!",

Man were those tostones GREAT! They have 2 dipping sauces, a garlic white sauce and green jalapeño sauce. At first the jalapeño sauce seemed mild but trust me it creeps up on you then BAM! The heat comes! Both were very tasty. Rice and beans were underwhelming, but I came for the chicken and that didn't dissapoint. Very juicy and flavorful. I'm a white meat kinda guy, and their's was very moist. As you all know there is an art to making the white meat moist on a chicken. Bravo Pio Pio!",

I hate to knock a restaurant for mediocre service, but as soon as we sat down, it took fifteen minutes to get drinks, and another table received their food despite arriving after us. This was on a Tuesday night, they were only moderately busy, and they do not require reservations. No excuses, the staff was friendly, but the service was very slow. The papaya juice was nauseating. Maybe it was my palate, but the milk with it tasted rancid. Drinks and service aside, the food is above average. I ordered the 1/4 chicken dinner with beans and plantains. The saffron rice complements the chicken well, and the beans are flavorful and filling, albeit a little too salty. The chicken is excellent, tender and juicy, but not as large of a portion as I had hoped. The redeeming factor is their plantains, sweet and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could eat a bucket of these, they were seriously that good! And the dipping sauces are great too, but for some reason they were brought with the drinks, thirty minutes before our food was brought. Weird. It's hard to find restaurants like this in Charlotte, certainly unique, and overall pretty tasty. Just don't waste two hours of your time eating there, do what the locals do and order it to go.",

We give him a heads up that they ran out of food, but he proceeds anyway to put in a to-go order. We were shocked by this revelation and my friend walked back in to confront the host for lying to us. Of course, at the same moment, two police officers walk in to pick up their orders. The conversation got heated, but the police officers told us to just go write a review and essentially intimidated us into leaving by telling us we were a \"disturbance.\" We left soon after because honestly I don't have enough funds for bail money.

Needless to say the deer won! \n\nI had damage to the grill, hood, right headlight, right fender and both right doors. So I reported the accident to our agent at State Farm and she asked were I wanted to take it to be fixed and I said anywhere but #1 Cochran Collision were we took it the last time, but I wasn't happy with their work. My wife suggested Eazor's because they are literally located right around the corner from our house. They are located on Long Road in Penn Hills.\n\nOur agent said how Eazor's was a top rated State Farm repair shop and how that was hard to do. So I took it down the next day and Ted the owner was there. He came outside and took tons of pictures of all the damage then put them on his computer and pulled up schematics of all the parts the car would need. He then ordered them and told me when to bring the car in which was about a week later because they were so busy. \n\nI then brought the car in when Ted said to and he even had Enterprise get a rental car ready for us. He even had one of his workers give us a ride to Enterprise to save time. Ted said the car would be done in six days and it was! They even detailed the car. It even looked better then the day we bought it from #1 Cochran! \n\nEazor's is open Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm. They also offer free pick up and delivery. I highly recommend him!",

At least I thought Howl at the Moon was a dueling piano chain? Perhaps on other nights of the week there are dueling pianos and you get that actual \"piano bar\" feel, but this Saturday it was one piano, drums, some guitarists and quite a few singers. I think I counted five singers in all during our couple of hours there. Honestly, although it was not a terrible experience by any means, I would not go back. \n\nThey charged a $5 cover, which I felt was completely reasonable given the live entertainment. Drinks are fairly priced, too. They just really pack people into this place like sardines. We spent more time shimmying past others to get back to the bar or get through the thick of crowds to the restroom than we did all together in a group dancing and enjoying the music. Countless times you are being run into by people drunker than you are, or making sure your toes do not get stepped on ... again. It was really just a glorified club. Too bad since Howl at the Moon (at least in other cities) used to be known for hosting a downright awesome dueling piano show. I see now that the description on Yelp is \"Dance Clubs, Bars\", so I should have known to expect that I suppose.\n\nThe band did a great job playing crowd-pleasing cover songs, and there were a few Bachelorette parties up on the stage having a great time. The bartenders were friendly and served us quickly every time one of us managed to squeeze on up to the bar, and the bathrooms were kept very clean by the attendant. I would not discourage someone looking for a fun night of dancing from going here, but I do recommend going a bit earlier in the evening (we went at 8:30p) so that you can grab a table a bit further away from the dance floor. Maybe over by the front windows would be a good spot. You can people-watch from there but still be close enough to the bar and the music to enjoy the experience just as much as those on the dance floor.",

When we went to use them, the bartender told us that the special was over, and that they drinks were full price. When I expressed my confusion, she got the manager. The manager (a blonde female) came barreling through the bar to YELL at me. She said the special was over, and I'm not using the tickets. She then took the tickets, ripped them and threw them out, and just said ok? The bartender (who was really sweet) apologized for the manager's terrible customer service.

The happy hour included two drinks for $1 each, which is a pretty good deal. It included a couple of beer options and some basic mixed drinks. \n\nI can't say I've ever been to a \"dueling piano bar\" before so this was an interesting experience. I don't know that \"dueling\" is really the right term, as it seemed like they were playing together for most of the time. There was a huge range of music played and the musicians were definitely very talented. But it was also very loud and hard to hold a conversation. \n\nThe space was just really odd to me. There is some seating up front, and then a giant bar right in the middle of the place, and a small stage in the corner that seemed almost like an afterthought. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it seems like it would make more sense to have the stage in a more central location than the back corner.\n\nMy group was standing near some high top tables around the bar, assuming we would be taken care of by the bar staff. Someone did come over to take our drink orders (and she returned several more times when our group needed another round). When I went to close my tab, I was informed that only person who took the orders could close it. This was kind of inconvenient because I had to wander around the bar until I found the girl who had helped us. It's nothing against her--she was nice and provided really quick service, I just found this system to be odd and annoying.\n\nThe happy hour was a good deal (because of my coworker), but I don't know if I would come back here on my own choice. Maybe it's just not my thing, but it was a very mediocre experience.",

They had a live band playing covers and they kept switching out singers, drummers, piano players, it really kept it fresh. Sometimes all the music blends together, but with the changing from female to male singers, it was easy to distinguish between the music. Unfortunately, after being there for a few hours, some of my friends noticed they were playing some of the songs over again. I mean, I'm not that mad, it's live music. \n\nThe crowd was a nice mix of early 30 somethings and older. There weren't a lot of young, \"new to drinking\", babies. Which is a nice change of pace. There is a nice dance floor and 2 bar areas. If you are hanging out at the top bar, I recommend not leaning or standing near the railing because the wait staff goes through there to get their customer's drinks and I got stepped on a few times, and beer spilled on my freshly dyed hair. It was annoying and a bit unorganized but the staff were apologetic to all of us. \n\nThey have drinks which I referred to as a \"Death bucket\" they are huge drinks with so much liquor that once you drink it all, you get to keep the bucket for the car ride home, to throw up in. They also have yard drinks, you know the Kennywood style slushy cups... my friend had a Fruit Roll Up flavored one but it was a little too sweet for my taste.

I am a huge fan of the Dueling Piano concept, so when I was in Pittsburgh this weekend, I was excited to head to Howl for one night as part of a Bachelor Party.  I hyped up the group of 11 I was with, and even ponied up for cover for the group ($5 cover on a Friday).  \n\nWe all had a good time, but I expected more from the dueling piano concept.  I requested 3 different songs, and each time sent up a $5 bill with the request, and had a grand total of 0 played.  One was a \"call-down\" song for the bachelor, which I can understand if they hadn't heard.  The second was a current radio song, which they seemed to know a bunch of.  The final request was for anything from Bruce Springsteen.  We were there for about 3 hours total, and I found it hard to believe that they couldn't play one request.  For the last hour or so, it seemed they didn't even look towards any request slips, and some that were played didn't even send up a tip.  Most dueling piano bars will let you know if they can't play it, and ask if you want to hear something else, or offer your money back.  I talked to some of the players at the end of the night, and while they did offer the money back (which I would never take), they said they didn't know how to play any of my requests (REALLY?  you don't know a single Springsteen song??).  In their defense, we did stop by the next night for last call, and they did learn to play Cheap Thrills, so kudos on that.\n\nOtherwise, drinks were fairly priced for downtown, and they had a good selection of beers as well.  The band was very talented, and everyone had a good time.  Dueling pianos always leads to a good night, but I think that this particular location could add a little bit of banter in between songs to interact with the crowd.

The band was decent, there was 5-6 piece with drums, bass, and lead guitar. Here's the problem, it's a dueling piano bar... Have some interaction with the audience.\n\nThey knew how to play all of the requests, but they all sound the same except for varying make or female vocals. \n\nThey must have a sign every five feet about \"winning\" a happy hour like every lame bar in the North Shore. Wise up folks, you don't really win anything.\n\nIf you're looking for a combination sports/dance bar with pleasant background music - this is your place.

This was a first time for me so not knowing what to expect I could tell quickly this was a dance club that sold a decent selection of beers but probably much more known for their over the top sweet boozing buckets that were stacked behind the bar.  \n\nWe were there early in the evening, maybe 6:15.  There was no other patrons at the time but they seemed to be getting set up for a night of piano playing and dancing.  I noticed some bouncers or something at the door that I assume would collect covers and card people but we were early and therefor were not asked for any money, which is good for them as I would have turned around and walked back out.  Sitting at the bar the bartenders seemed nice.  There were a lot of them standing around and talking to each other.  I'm guessing they are much more useful say around 10 PM or so, than at 6:15 with two guests.\n\nAfter two drinks we took off for the show.  Not a bad place but I am guessing I won't be returning since it's undoubtedly loud and annoying, during their \"peak hours\" filled with drunk kids who are blasting buckets of cheap liquor and sweet mixers who will inevitably vomit hopefully in a toilet.  Not my bag baby.  But during the day, not a bad place.",

Considering that the only drinks that you could purchase with the tickets were Miller Light, Coors Light or Angry Orchard, that kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. Even outside of the \"free\" drinks their on tap list was pretty limited. I'm fine paying for nicer stuff, but charging for what amounts to beer pong beer at a promotional event seems out of place. \n\nThe piano play was okay.

There was a band playing well-known covers, and they continually invited a member of the audience to come up and sing with them. There are two bars, the first at the top, and the second main one near the stage.\n\nThe crowd was a nice mix of late-20s/early-30s and older. I haven't seen too many younger people here. On the main floor, there were several tables and chairs, and plenty of seats at the main bar. Of course, they were all taken on this night.\n\nThe bartenders at the main bar were the real superstars that night. There were at least three bartenders attending to 10-20 people at any given time. I have never seen bartenders move so fast with accuracy and precision. I didn't even mind waiting 5-10 minutes to order my drinks because I knew they were working very hard. When I got my drinks, they were pretty good. I especially liked the St. Germain Lemonade, which is a cocktail containing Deep Eddy Lemon Vodka, St. Germain, strawberry puree. I saw several people getting buckets and tall bones of cocktails. I heard that people keep the buckets for them to throw up in on their ride home or at home...\n\nThe men's restroom was interesting. There were people clustering at the entrance to the restroom, so I thought it was packed and stood in line. After a minute, I realized that there wasn't an actual line; instead, people were watching a paper chess game. There was a chess game. In the men's restroom. I can't imagine how people could be lucid enough to play a game of chess after having had multiple drinks. After doing my business, I saw that there multiple gum packets free for us to take. There was even a \"restroom attendant\" passing out paper towels, chatting with us, and participating in the chess matches. I thought those were interesting touches to an otherwise bland bar/club restroom experience.\n\nI'd probably visit this place again with friends.

The venue was a great size for our city and set up well, except that the stage was in a back corner and the bar was surrounded by tvs with sports channels on, giving it a sports bar vibe. The lighting was fun and night-clubby without being too flashy. \n\nBecause this was a media preview night, I felt the crowd was not as appropriate for the vibe and music as it might (and hopefully will) be on a regular Friday or Saturday night. People weren't of the dancing mindset, except for a few individuals. I was most surprised by the music, as it was advertised as a piano bar, but instead delivered a full band that played high-energy pop songs all night. My peers and I had assumed it would be more of a dueling piano bar, especially because they had two pianos facing each other on the stage. The performances were well done and a lot of fun, but I would have liked a variety of genres and moods instead of all fast popular music. I would have preferred more audience interaction, since it just seemed like they were playing a set. Though they did take one of my requests, they did not have any dialogue in between songs, nor did it seem much like improv. This was a little confusing given that they had song request forms on every table.\n\nThe drinks were flowing and they were overall pretty delicious. They have a nice selection of drinks for both the beer drinker and those who'd rather enjoy some hard liquor. They give recommended size options depending on the size of your party--the largest being a giant 84 oz bucket. \n\nThis seems like a great girls' night out option and something fun and different to do to switch up the typical happy hour hop around the outside neighborhoods. It's a nice change to the cultural district area and hopefully will evolve into something everyone can enjoy.",

When I tried this falafel, I knew I had found a place for me!  Additionally, the meat was so tender and delicious!  The kabob mix, with chicken, beef and kefta was amazing!  The food is incredibly fresh an excellent quality.  I will agree that the hummus is not as flavorful as some I had, but it was still very fresh.  Since it's a family recipe, I just thought maybe their family didn't like as strong of a flavor to it?  Plus I find most people to think hummus is supposed to taste like the stuff from the market or Trader Joes.  That's not real hummus.\n\n It was a bit slow in preparation, but they haven't been in business that long, and making everything fresh does take more time.

We have static stickers on the window but it happens sometimes and usually they shake it off and go on about their day.  This little guy was not so lucky.  I watched him struggle and try to come to but after a while I knew he wasn't doing well.  I went out and helped him into a box and brought him in to my office, placed him in a dark, quiet place (drawer), but he was not coming around so I searched wildlife rehabilitation centers in Cleveland to find out if there was somewhere I could take him.  The Google directed me to the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center.  I called and they said to bring him right over.  I loaded the bird in the car and hauled over to Bay Village.  There, I was greeted by a very nice woman who asked if I had an animal and escorted me back into what looked like a completely outfitted doctor's examination room.  Shortly, in walks Dominic, a biologist I assume, maybe an ornithologist based on his knowledge of birds.  Sadly the bird died probably due to internal trauma.  Dominic held him and told me that they would donate his body to an ornithology program for their collection.  I am sad but I am heartened to know that there is a resource available in our community to help wild animals in distress.

We went to Foundation Room, Light, Chateau, and you could take a limo to the strip club anytime. There were about 10 people in total. It was a blast. I was skeptical at first but Ceasar is the man! Really hooked us up! Got us into clubs with no waiting for free and they didn't even enforce the dress code on us and we had a member in gym shoes getting into these clubs were it looks like the dress code is strictly enforced. Drinks were strong and plentiful on the bus and he took us to the Las Vegas sign. \n\nThe next day I get a text from Cesar letting me know that if we want he could send a limo to pick us up from anywhere we want to take us to a strip club with free entry. We were in old vegas and decided to give it a shot at about 11. The limo arrived at around 11:30 and took us to the strip club AND back to our hotel at about 3 am.

The guy who answered the phone said I needed to email them to make a reservation and couldn't do it over the phone. I didn't have a problem making the reservation and received a confirmation \"thanks\" email the next day. The day of the party bus we got a text from Cesar who was our tour guide for the evening. It said he was outside the first bar, well my girlfriend and I were there 30 min prior and he didn't show up until 15 after the scheduled time. At which he informed us that there was only 1 other couple for a total of 4 people for the night and because of the small group wasn't able to get the party bus. My whole reason for booking this was to use the party bus and get the open bar because I don't care for nightclubs. Cesar was very kind and apologetic for the inconvenience. We understood it's not his fault that people didn't book it. He gave us 3 options:\n\n1) He would take us to the first three venues and we would skip the  last venue and he would refund us the groupon amount.\n\n2) allow us to join tomorrow's group\n\n3) Go to all 4 venues and take a limo instead of a party bus and still include open bar on the limo.\n\nWe chose option 3. Our venues included house of blues at Mandalay bay, foundation room at Mandalay bay, LAX at Luxor, and chateau at Paris. \n\nWe went to the first 2 venues and once we got to LAX they were closed even though they were suppose to be open that night. Cesar told us he would not charge us and refund the groupon but allow us to continue the rest of the tour. \n\nWe got to the limo and it was older and the leather seats were ripped. There was a bottle of Smirnoff and Bacardi along with cranberry juice or Coke. No beer. We took a tour along the strip, stopped at the Vegas sign and the driver allowed us to make a quick pee stop at a hotel. We met back up with Cesar at chateau and were on our own from there. Cesar told us he would allow us to join the bus crawl tomorrow at no charge. \n\nCesar was very polite and accommodating. He made sure we got into each venue without issue, he was apologetic for the night not turning out the way it was suppose too. We understand it's not his fault that lax was closed or there wasn't enough people for a party bus. I feel he did everything he could to make it up to us and we still had a good night.\n\nThe next day we received a text from Cesar saying that the bus tour crawl was cancelled because there was no one for the group.",

I'm writing this to warn you.  \n\nWhen it first started, our tour guide (who on his badge said Party Expert) was a little awkward  but hey we'll see how this plays out. Somehow we were the only people on the tour. House of Blues. Eh. What you would expect I guess. Finally 3 more people on our tour. Yaaaaaay!!!!!! We went to the foundation room. Pretty cool bar, good view, and hot dancers.\n\nWe should have stayed there because LAX was a very very very  poor decision. Its like one of those shitty Mexican clubs that tries to be really good but completely fails at it. It may just be an undercover club for the cartel to launder money because I don't understand how they're\nopen. The quality of people is pretty bad. I mean you shouldn't consistently smell hard boiled eggs in the club. 15 minutes later we pretty much went to go look for our guide and said we were ready for the next spot. he said we have to wait for our \"three amigos\". A little racist but ooooooookay. So we gambled while we waited for the \"three amigos\". Finally its time to go!!!! Our party expert said some of his friends were joining. Yaaaaaaay. We needed more people on this bar crawl!!!!!!!! Well I guess his friends were replacing the three amigos that paid. That's fair. Your friends in place of actual customers.\n\nSo we get into party bus that was more of like a nice van, definitely not a party bus. He has a random red cooler with already used alcohol, and mixers that were probably sitting in the Vegas heat ALL DAY. Drinks were hot and old, but booze is booze I guess. \n\nWe stopped at Vegas sign. Big deal. Then we get to Chateau in Paris. We were in what we thought was the line to get into club for a while. Apparently our party expert was charging his friends after all and turns out we were at the ATM for quite some time. Then when walking to club he left half our group. After we find him he's yelling how we have to hurry up and stay\ntogether. DUDE!!!! You just had us at the ATM for 20 f@@@ing minutes so you can pocket some money and now you're in a rush. Are you serious? \n\nAs for Chateau it was fun but the staff and bouncers are a-holes in my opinion. You pretty much can't stand can't sit anywhere, bartenders  won't give you water unless you pay $7 and there's a line to leave. Fastest way to leave is to get kicked out which we managed to do. \n\nAll in all. Don't waste your money or time. There are much better bar crawls in Vegas. Clubs weren't great, lack of people on crawl was the worst part, not to mention the possibly racist guide.",

Ended up waiting until 2:30ish when the head of the parade finally arriving.\n\nThe scene on the audience side was chaotic when the parade arrived. There were kids sitting on blankets at the front and the parents would get defensive whenever they see people blocking the children's view. One mom was swearing the entire time to get the crowd to move away lol. So just be careful of angry parents.\n\nThe parade itself was pretty fun, there were marching bands, people walking in costumes, clowns that you could take pictures with, and of course the colorful floats. I wish there weren't many large gaps between different sections of the parade. The gaps made the parade around 1 hour long and my legs were so tense when the event was over.",

Rote Bete Carpaccio mit Olivenöl-Zitronen-Marinade und Balsamico. Dazu wurde baguette gereicht. Ok\n\n\n 2. Gemüsecremsuppe (pürriert) mit etwas Schnittlauch oben drauf. Kreativität glech null und für diesen Menüpreis einfach zu wenig.\n\n\n 3.Carpaccio von dreierlei Fisch (geräucherter Lachs, die anderen beiden weiss ich nicht mehr). Die Kochkunst bestand aus dem Öffnen der Verpackung drei Fischpackungen und dem drappieren von je 2 Scheiben auf dem teller, was allerdings schon recht früh geschehen sein musste, das der lachs aussen bereits angetrocknet und am Teller festgeklebt war. Dazu gabs Olivenöl-Zitronen-Marinade und Balsamico...ja genau die vom ersten Gang.\n\n\n 4.Vorbemerkung: Vor dem Essen wurden wir gefragt ob wir lieber Fisch oder Fleisch als Hauptgang hätten, wobei auf Nachfrage als Fleisch ein Rinderfilet oder ein Kalbsfilet oder etwas in der Art nach Laune des Chefs angeboten wurde...der launige Chef suchte dann einen Schmorbraten vom Rind aus, den er mit einer ungenießbaren Polenta versah und mit Zuckerschoten, die durch das lange Kochen (es reicht völlig aus sie kurz zu blancchieren um ein knackiges gutschmeckendes Gemüse zu erhalten) bereits Grautöne angenommen hatten. Umrahmt wurde das ganze mit einer ca. 1cm breiten Ölspur. Das ging Richtung ungenießbar.\n\n\n 5. Tartuffo mit Sahne. im Supermarkt in der tiefkühltheke gekauft und auf den teller gelegt...aber immerhin besser als das was der koch selbst fabriziert hatte.\n\n\n 6. Wein: Die Flasche Rose-Wein für18,50 EUR, (die einzige auf der Karte) die wir uns ausgesucht hatten gabs leider nicht und uns wurde eine andere Flasche aus Italien angeboten, die er uns großzügigerweise zum gleichen Preis überlassen würde. Die Internetrecherche ergab später einen Einkaufspreis von 3,90 EUR\n\n\n FAZIT: So schön kann die Aussicht da oben gar nicht sein, dass ich für ein solches Essen nochmals 55 EUR zahlen möchte....um ehrlich zu sein würde ich es nicht mal mehr essen, wenn ich es geschenkt bekäme...dann doch lieber zu Mc\n\n\n Allerdings muss ich der Fairness halber hinzufügen, dass die Spaghetti Carbonara und das Putensteak in Rahmsoße unserer Kinder gut geschmeckt haben und auch das Schnitzel mit Pommes am Nachbartisch sah verlockend aus....warum versucht man also nicht einfach das zu kochen was man kann anstatt Ausflüge in die gehobenere Gastronomie zu unternehmen und aus dem 20.

            "text" : "Wir wahren gestern Abend im Bella Vista essen und haben uns auf einen schönen Abend zu Zweit gefreut, nachdem wir den Babysitter organisiert hatten. Die Online-Reservierung hat sehr gut funktioniert. An unseren Plätzen angekommen, haben wir unser Essen und die Getränke gewählt. \nAls Vorspeise haben wir Bruschetta und Vitello tonnato bestellt. Die Bruschetta kam gänzlich ohne Würze. Wir haben 5 Minuten gewartet, bis eine Kellnerin vorbei kam, die wir nach einer Pfeffermühle fragen konnten. Ein einfacher Salzstreuer stand von Anfang an bereits auf dem Tisch. Das Vitello tonnato war in Ordnung. Wir haben der Kellnerin die Rückmeldung gegeben, dass das Bruschetta hätte wenigstens ein wenig mit Salz und Pfeffer gewürzt sein können. Es bestand ja lediglich aus Tomatenstücken auf geröstetem Brot mit Balsamicocreme überzogen. Ihre Antwort aus der Küche war, dass sich am Vortag Gäste beschwert hätten, dass das Bruschetta zu würzig war. Dann gänzlich auf sämtliches Salz und sämtlichen Pfeffer zu verzichten ist auch keine Lösung oder man stellt den Gästen etnsprechend Salz und Pfeffer zur Verfügung. Abgesehen davon war das Bruschetta ziemlich durchgeweicht.\nUnmittelbar nach der Vorspeise kamen unsere beiden Hauptgerichte: Saltimbocca und Scallopine. Bisher dachte ich, dass das Fleisch schon tot ist, wenn es auf dem Teller liegt, aber sicherheitshalber wurde es nochmals in der Weißweinsoße ertränkt. Nachdem ich die ganze Soße vom Fleisch heruntergekratzt hatte, habe ich auch endlich etwas vom Salbei und dem Parmaschinken schmecken können. Schade, denn der Geschmack dann war nicht schlecht. Das gegrillte Gemüse war ein wenig zu fettig und wieder einmal gänzlich ungewürtzt. Leider wurde uns in der Zwischenzeit die Pfeffermühle wieder entzogen, da andere Gäste diese auch brauchten. Hätte ich diese doch bloß bei uns am Tisch stehen gelassen Die Rosmarinkartoffeln waren teilweise schwarz angebrannt. Die optisch gute Seite nach oben gelegt, wohl nach dem Motto der Gast sieht's dann nicht. Während des gesamten Essens kam keine Kellnerin vorbei, um zu fragen, ob alles in Ordnung sei. So mußte ich bis zum Abdecken warten, um über die Qualität des Essens zu berichten. \nNeben dem Essen gibt es auch einige Kritikpunkte am Personal zu erwähnen. Als Gast hat man das Gefühl, dass das Mitdenken bzw. das Vorausdenken beim Personal selten durchgeführt wird. Wenn ich zwei Gerichte bestelle, decke ich entweder von Beginn an noch zusätzlich einmal Besteck mehr mit ein oder wenn ich die Vorspeise abdecke und sehe, dass das Besteck mit auf dem Teller liegt, decke ich vor dem Servieren der Hauptspeise nochmals Besteck ein. Uns erst die Teller zu reichen und dann vom Nebentisch in eine Hand schnell Messer und Gabel zu greifen und mir herüberzureichen ist Bierzeltmanier. Da hätten sie's einfach ganz lassen sollen und ich hätte mir vom gegenüberliegenden Platz selber das Besteck genommen. Zusätzlich ist neben dem ungepflegten Erscheinungsbild besonders einer Kellnerin, ist von Gastfreundlichkeit kaum etwas zu merken. Der Gast bestellt und bekommt das, was er bestellt hat, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Das kurz nach dem Servieren einmal nachgefragt wird, ob das Essen in Ordnung sei, erfolgt nie. Wenn man etwas bestellen möchte, sind längere Wartezeiten in Kauf zu nehmen. Wir hätten gerne noch ein Dessert bestellt, nachdem aber nach 20 (!) Minuten erst eine Kellnerin kam und nachfragte, ob wir noch etwas möchten, haben wir nur noch nach der Rechnung verlangt. Als Entschuldigung brachte sie uns dann zwei Limoncello. Auch etwas lieblos, denn bei der Lage ist zu erwarten, dass unter den Gästen höchstwahrscheinlich auch Autofahrer dabei sind bzw. es auch Menschen gibt, die so etwas nicht trinken. Wir haben dementsprechend den Limoncello zurückgegeben. Uns vielleicht vorher zu fragen, ob man uns als Entschuldigung einen Limoncello, Espresso etc. bringen kann, wäre wesentlich intelligenter gewesen. \nUnser Fazit: der Abend war eine Erfahrung gewesen und wir wissen nun, dass wir das Bella Vista nicht empfehlen können!",

Das rechtfertigt natürlich auch eine gewisse Erwartungshaltung bei uns. Nicht stimmig ist die übervolle oder zu klein geplante Gardarobe, aber das kann man ja ändern wenn man möchte.\nDie Begrüßung war freundlich. Die Freundlichkeit setzte sich auch den ganzen Abend beim Service fort. Variable Vielfalt in höchster Qualität verspricht die Küche, die Speisekarte orientiert sich Richtung Italien, der hiesigen Region und je ein Salat erinnert an Nizza und New York.\nWir wählten als Vorspeise Carpaccio und Vitello Tonnato.\nDas Carpaccio war hauchdünn, mit gutem Olivenöl, Rucola und Parmesan, das Kalbfleich vom Vitello ebenfalls dünn und schön zart mit einer ganz leckeren Thunfischsauce. Der Parmesan war für mich noch ganz jung, da hätte ich mir lieber z. B.  einen milden Gran Padano oder ähnliches gewünscht.\nEin tolles und geschmackvolles Hauptgericht war Saltimbocca Romana mit Kalbfleisch, Parmaschinken und Salbei, Rosmarinkartoffeln und Grillgemüse. Hier lobe ich ganz besonders wieder das zarte Kalbfleisch sowie die Rosmarinkartoffeln.  Auch das Scaloppina, ebenfalls zartes Kalbfleisch in einer köstlichen Weissweinsauce mit Rosmarinkartoffeln und Grillgemüse war super.\nBeim Saltimbocca hätte ich mir als Parmaschinken z. B. den San Daniele gewünscht, allerdings müsste dann auch der Preis ein wesentlich höherer sein.\nIn Summe waren die Gerichte qualitativ gut und vom Geschmack her eine runde Sache. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis bei den Speisen und Getränken ist für mein Budget stimmig.\nIch persönlich würde sogar noch hochwertigere und hochpreisige Speisen als Alternativen anbieten und die Zutaten auf der Karte im Detail notieren wie z. B. Parmaschinken 12 Monate / 24 Monate, oder San Daniele, dann argumentieren sich die Preise fast von selbst oder das Serviceteam steht beratend zur Seite und hat einen zusätzlichen Kontakt mit den Gästen.",

Da das Wetter eine fantastische Sicht in Richtung Süden auf die Alb versprach, entschieden wir uns nach einem eher mäßig zufriedenstellenden Besuch 10 Monate zuvor zu einem weiteren Versuch. Leider blieb die Aussicht aus dem 20. Stockwerk das einzige positive Erlebnis. Mehr Schein als Sein, so könnte das Motto in dem modern, allerdings unpersönlich-fantasielos ausgestatteten Lokal lauten. Die Speisekarte führt ein Zwitterdasein: Man weiß nicht, ob man sich in einem italienischen oder deutsch-schwäbischen Restaurant befindet. Aber auch der anschließende Verzehr gibt keinen Aufschluss, beide Richtungen werden gleichermaßen fade bzw. laienhaft zubereitet. Schade um die wunderschöne Gelegenheit, ein Juwel zu zaubern.\nBedienung\nWar der Service durch eine freundliche Dame beim ersten Besuch noch angenehm, so gerieten wir diesmal in den Genuss zweier Kellner, die erst im Laufe der Zeit ihre Herablassung mäßigten.

Wir bestellten zweimal Sauerbraten, Tomaten mit Mozzarella und Tagliatelle mit Lachs. War die Pasta laut Auskunft unseres Gastes noch passabel, so wies der Sauerbraten eine Konsistenz auf, die der immer wieder gern zitierten Schuhsohle nicht unähnlich war und einen Rest\"genuss\" aus den Zahnzwischenräumen auch noch nach Tagen gewährleistete. Die Spätzle sowie die Soße hierzu waren liebevoll in irgendeiner Fabrik zusammengekleistert. Ein Dessert erübrigte sich auf diese Weise.\nHierzu bestellten wir italienischen Rotwein, ein Barbera wurde auf der Tafel an der Theke als Besonderheit angepriesen - er war trinkbar, aber auch nicht besser als die beiden anderen Sorten.\n\nDas Ambiente\nPhänomenale Höhenlage mit Blick zur Schwäbischen Alb, große Fenster, die meisten Tische in guter Position.

Ambiente geht in Ordnung, ist einrichtungstechnisch schön gestaltet, der Service gab zunächst auch Hoffnung auf ein gutes Erlebnis, die Leistung der Küche hält jedoch dem offensichtlich gehobenen Selbstverständnis der Lokalität bei Weitem nicht Stand.\nWir waren nicht gekommen um einen kulinarischen Hochgenuss zu erleben, jedoch muß man rückblickend sagen, daß es schon immer sehr verdächtig ist, wenn man eine Speisekarte vorfindet, die Gerichte querfeldein durch alle möglichen Genres anbietet, das kennt man ja vom nächstbesten asiatisch/orientalischen Pizzabringdienst um die Ecke.\nDie Bestellung belief sich auf einen Salat als Hauptgang mit Maultaschen, einen Beilagensalat sowie Penne quattro formaggi. Der Beilagensalat wurde serviert, nachdem der Hauptgang bereits auf dem Tisch stand, die Maultaschen waren vollkommen totgebraten, zudem schmeckten Teile davon verdorben. Das Dressing der Salate kam aus der Packung, Brot zum Hauptgang-Salat Fehlanzeige. Die Zusammenstellung der Salate, also Beilagen- wie auch Hauptgang-Salat war bis auf eine etwas größere Dimensionierung und der verdorbenen Maultaschen die Gleiche.\nDie Penne war immerhin al dente gekocht, dies muß hervorgehoben werden, die Sauce war vollkommen 0815 und entsprang vermutlich auch dem Convenience-Programm. Nach Reklamation der verschiedenen Punkte kam keinerlei Reaktion, weswegen wir das Lokal schnell verlassen haben, und sicher so schnell nicht wieder herkommen werden.\nFazit: Absolut nicht empfehlenswert, der Ausblick ist herrlich, die Leistung der Küche ist hingegen vollkommen unterirdisch. Schwer zu erklären, warum sich solch ein Lokal angesichts der Dichte an wirklich guten Restaurants mit hervorragender Küche zu fairen Preisen in der Region halten kann. Auf Dauer wird die Aussicht allein das hoffentlich nicht kompensieren. Da sollte jedem das Geld zu schade sein um es im Bella Vista auszugeben.",

Neben einheimischen Weinen werden nur edlere, daher realtiv teure Weine angeboten. Meine daraufhin bestellte saure Weißweinschorle (0,2: 3,40) war auch keine gute Wahl - es war mir zu süßlich und schmeckte abgestanden.  Fehlanzeige auch bei den Desserts: es gab nur 2 auf der Karte.- Der nicht überfreundliche Service war flott und korrekt, so dass wir bei solch heißem Wetter das klimatisierte, in kühlem Design und kühlen Farben gehaltene Lokal als recht angenehm empfanden - im Winter kann ich mir das nicht so recht vorstellen. Alles einwandfrei sauber; außerdem gibt es eine kleine, abgeteilte Raucherlounge.",

Vorab wurde abgeklärt dass wir Musik im Nebenzimmer bekommen, als wir dann dort waren, sagte man uns man könne nur den Fernseher anmachen und Viva oder MTV schauen. Na super und das auf einer Firmenweihnachtsfeier. Als Empfang wählten wir Sekt und Bruscetta Häppchen. Der Sekt war schon fast getrunken, dann kamen die Häppchen und das nur nach Aufforderung. Es waren die schlechtesten Bruscetta meines Lebens. Danach das Menü: Bei mir ein Vitello Tonato, welches schon am Rande so ausgetrocknet war, dass man es fast nicht hinuterbrachte. Die Kellnerinnen musste man jedes Mal auffordern doch bitte noch Wasserflaschen zu bringen. Danach kamen Tagliatelle mit Pesto, also so hieß das Gericht zuminderst. Die Nudeln waren so verkocht, dass man nicht mal mehr eine Gabel brauchte. Ein Löffel für die Pampe war ausreichend. Ausgemacht waren übrigens Tagliatelle-Nester. Der Hauptgang Zander mit Rosmarinkartoffeln und gegrilltem Gemüse bestand aus zäher Fischsohle mit kalten Kartoffeln und fettigem Gemüse. Der Nachtisch war noch einigermaßen erträglich, aber nicht der Rede wert. Was auch noch erwähnenswert wäre, dass nicht einmal genügend Weinflaschen vorhanden waren. Wenn man doch weiß, dass eine Weihnachtsfeier mit 30 Personen im Hause ist, dann habe ich doch genügend Wein im Haus. \nDer Chef des Hauses hat uns dann am Schluss aber mit seinem Aufstand gehörig das Fest verdorben. \nFAZIT: Dringend die Finger weglassen! Hier muss etwas geschehen das Lokal wäre allein mit seiner Aussicht eine Wucht. Wenn hier ein anderer Inhaber mit anderem Personal zu Gange wäre, wäre es bestimmt toll, man könnte was draus machen.",

Wir wollten uns unsere Meinung selber bilden, da wir von Natur aus sehr kulinarisch verwöhnt sind.\nDen Tisch hatten wir vorab reserviert, da uns gesagt wurde, dass das Restaurant sehr gut besucht wird. An einem Freitag Abend wurden wir charmant und sehr höflich an unseren Tisch geführt. Wir aßen als Vorspeise einen Antipastiteller, bestehend aus einer sehr guten und üppigen Mischung diverser Vorspeisehäppchen und eine Tomatensuppe, welche sehr gut abgestimmt war. Die Vorspeise hat uns überzeugt. Im Anschluss bestellten wir eine Pizza und ein Lachssteak. Beides stellte sich als eine hervorragende Wahl aus. Die Pizza schmeckte wie frisch aus Italien und das Lachssteak war ein richtiger Gaumenschmaus. \nUnser Nachtisch bestand aus einem Tiramisu, welcher unseren Abend abrundete. Gut verköstigt und glücklich saßen wir im 20. Stockwerk und genießten eine atemberaubende Aussicht.\nDie Bedienung war sehr höflich und zuvorkommend.

Wir waren mittags da, konnten verschiedene Wetterszenarien beobachten und die Schwäbische Alb in immer neuen Belichtungen sehen.\nWir hatten das 3-Gänge-Überraschungsmenü, welches mit Aperitiv für 2 Personen 80 Euro kosten soll und bei Schwabendeal für 34,90 angeboten wurde. Auf der Karte kostet es -ohne Aperitiv  24,90. Dieses Menü ist nach den Einzelpreisen in der Karte nicht nachvollziehbar. Anstatt der in Aussicht gestellten Vorspeisen wie Carpaccio vom Rind oder Vitello Tonnato gab es einen Antipasti-Teller, bestehend aus Rucola, Parmesan, luftgetrocknetem Schinken und getrockneten Tomaten. Sehr lecker und schön angerichtet, aber halt die Sparversion für Gutscheininhaber.\nHauptgang Fisch oder Fleisch mit jeweils den gleichen Beilagen: Gemüseratatouille und Teigtäschchen. Beides vollkommen in Ordnung  nur das medium bestellte Steak war ganz durch gebraten, aber immerhin zart und lecker. Das Steak badete in einer feinen Thymiansauce, die bis zum letzten Rest aufgesaugt wurde und zusätzlichen Mühlenpfeffer überflüssig machte.\nDessert: Profiterolles mit heißen Himbeeren  auch ok.\nInsgesamt war der angesagte Gutscheinwert von 80 Euro für 2 Personen nicht erreicht  es waren im Vergleich zur Karte vielleicht gerade mal 56 Euro, bei einem Gutscheinpreis von 34,90 Euro. Somit die Ersparnis mit Gutschein nicht 50%, sondern gerade mal 37,5%  aber das ist ja auch nicht schlecht.\nMich würde mal interessieren, ob anderen Gästen mit Gutschein jemals die angesagten Vorspeisen wie Rindercarpaccio oder Vitello Tonnato angeboten wurden. Ich vermute stark, daß IMMER ein billiger Antipastiteller gereicht wird, da die beiden genannten Vorspeisen mit jeweils 9,50 Euro auf der Karte angeboten werden und eben NICHT Inhalt der Überraschungsvorspeise sind. Bezüglich dieses Punktes bleibt ein unangenehmer Nachgeschmack, hereingelegt worden zu sein  und darauf sollten auch Anbieter wie Schwabendeal etc. achten und ihre Angebote ehrlicher beschreiben.",

Stock angekommen, kamen wir in den Eingangsbereich, der extrem (unangenehm) nach Rauch roch. Später sahen wir, dass es hier einen Raucheraum gibt. Zur Entschuldigung des Restaurants ist wohl aus Sicherheitsgründen ein Rauchen auf dem Balkon nicht erlaubt.\nDas REstaurant war extrem leer. Nach den schlechten Kritiken hier wunderte uns das jedoch nicht.\nWir haben über Groupon ein 3-Gänge-Verwöhnmenü bestellt, das nachfolgend beschrieben wird. Einen Stern-Abzug gibt es für die \"Verarsche\" (entschuldigen Sie bitte den Ausdruck!) - aber uns wurde ein 3-Gänge-Menü für anstatt 80 Euro für 40 Euro mit 50 % Rabatt angeboten. In der Speisekarte ist dieses Menü jedoch für 24 Euro/Persone zu finden. Getränke sind extra zu berappen. Da habe ich mich wirklich verarscht gefühlt!! Jaja, da kann man natürlich sagen, dass man vorher das Angebot prüfen sollte. Aber wenn ich 50 % Rabatt angepriesen bekomme, glaube ich das - zumal bei Groupon diese Angebote (meist) stimmen.\nNun zum Essen/Service:\nDer Service war sehr nett. Der Kellner war sehr bemüht, kam fortwährend - fragte immer, ob alles in Ordnung sei. Jede Speise wurde uns exakt erklärt.\nVorspeise war ein Ruccola-Salat mit Wald-Himbeeren/Balsamico-Schaum und Shrimps auf Aubergine. Sehr ansehnlich und geschmacklich einwandfrei.\nHauptgang war die Auswahl zwischen Fisch und Fleisch. Wir entschieden uns für das Rinder-Medaillion. Es war exakt \"medium\" gebraten, auf Bohnen mit Raviolis mit Frischkäse/Pinienkernen und schwarzer Ravioli auf weisser Trüffelfüllung. Optisch sehr schön - geschmacklich ebenso.\nNachspeise:\nGefüllter Blätterteig mit Schokosoße - für mich etwas zu viel Schoko - aber auch hier optisch/geschmacklich sehr gut.\nUm ca. 21:30 h waren wir mit dem Essen fertig. Da das Lokal nicht sehr gut besucht war, wurden dann auch schon die Lichter ausgeschaltet. Das empfanden wir etwas als \"Rausschmiss\". \nBei der Anmeldung sagte ich, dass es der 50. Geburtstag meines Mannes sei. Bei guten Restaurants wird dann ein wenig schöner eingedeckt oder dem Gast gratuliert. Leider nichts von allem.\nGetränke kamen flott. Die Weinauswahl lässt sehr zu wünschen übrig. Keine guten/hochwertigen Weine. Für all die o.g. Punkte nochmals Abzug.\nDas Essen war WIRKLICH gut. Da kann man nichts sagen. Wir sind viel in guten Restaurants unterwegs - auch in Asien (Shanghai, Seoul etc.). \nAber das \"Tüpfelchen\" fehlt - trotz der tollen Aussicht und auch des guten Essens muss ich wohl nicht nochmals hin....

We could not have made this move any easier on these guys, everything was boxed and ready to go and since we were moving cross country we did not have any furniture aside from bunkbeds for our kids.

My neighbor even made the comment to me saying he didn't even realize we had movers since he only saw my hubby and I move boxes. These guys were a complete joke, I had even mentioned it to the owner, but he did absolutely nothing.

It was not set to expire until July 2016.  For some reason when I went in to check on using it, it was redeemed by Kyle at Pearson Moving for another Kathleen on this same site.  I have no idea why that happened.  I have spoken to Kyle several times he refuses to resolve this issue and let me have my two hours and call it good.  It was his mistake to start with.  He has had several times to make it right, but said he will not return the money only Living Social can do that (when I called them they said he has to), and then he said he is also charging for a trip charge of $89 and $89 per hour if I go over my two ours.  I have never heard of someone making a mistake at a company, especially an owner, and not bending over backwards to make it right with the customer.  We are the ones that sustain the company with word of mouth recommendations and make paychecks possible!  There is no mention of the $89 charges on the Living Social coupon, and he said their website is on it so I should have looked it up.  If any of you are smart, run from this company.  They do not value their customers.  Kathleen N., I am glad you got to use my Living Social Coupon.  I am not sure how that happened, but I got the short end of the stick!",

They didn't wrap my furniture and scratched many of my items ***\n\nEverything was great until they arrived at my new home. They didn't wrap any pictures, all the frames rubbed against each other. They didn't wrap my baby furniture (all brand new as my baby shower was a month before we moved and our baby was only 6 weeks old at the time we moved) and the furniture has little nicks and scratches, dings, etc. all over. I have a white corduroy nursing chair that they wedged between dusty boxes and didn't wrap in plastic, or moving pads, etc.\n\nWhen I pointed this out, they took a few pictures and said they would have their boss call me on Monday. It has been 21 days and I finally, after 5 voicemail to Hayden, heard back from Kyle, the owner. He offered me a $20 credit to \"buy some wood putty\"  and insulted me for not taking insurance out. I was assured based on the paperwork that I signed that I had coverage of 60 cents per pound of my entire load in case anything was broken.  Now I am told it is per item, how misleading!\n\nSo now I have all brand new baby furniture that looks like it has been dragged through the back of a budget rental truck with Pearson Moving stickers on it and they wont fix it. \n\nI even tipped these guys $100 each for their hard work. I'm not saying they didn't work hard, moving is hard work. But they didn't use an ounce of intelligence when moving my life from AZ to Orange County and for that... I say find somebody else who is a bit smarter and will respect your belongings. \n\nI had to click a star so I will click one.

How can he do that unless he is seriously over charging in the first place!)\nSo I paid $99 for some x-rays and didn't get my teeth cleaned.  \nAs a side note, I heard the hygienist say to another employee who questioned an open package containing an instrument, \"Oh, you can put that back in the cupboard; I only opened it with my bare hands.\"\nDO NOT GO HERE!

Can they clean your teeth? yes. The office is clean and everyone was nice. .Now to the bad.  I had dental insurance at all the visits. Before I would have anything done I always asked  what it would cost me. I was told they checked my insurance and i was 100%  covered. The next visit I do not owe any money and everything they were doing  that day was covered by insurance.  Now 2 years later I am getting bills. My insurance says Do NOT PAY.   I was told by impressions dental that they had an office manager that did not know what she was doing at the time and did not submit insurance correctly.  My insurance says it's not my fought and I am not responsible for Impressions Dental not knowing what they are doing.  The dentist office had one year to get the paper work correct and they did not. So in conclusion. 1. When  Impressions Dental tell you it's all good and you are covered by your insurance at 100% don't take their word for it because it has to be turned in to the insurance in order for insurance to pay  2. When you go in six months later and they say you don't owe money and that your insurance took care of it.  Don't take their word. They will send you $ 402 bill for two cleanings and 4 teeth sealants that you were told were paid for by insurance and would have been if turned in. My insurance says the services would  have been paid for if they had got the paperwork within the one year deadline. My insurance did not pay after the year deadline and let impressions dental know they can not bill me because it was a non billable denial.  I would love to support local Dentist and gave it a chance but my family goes elsewhere now and we have not had any billing issues.",

On top of that, the dentist found a \"small cavity\" that he put a rather large filling in, yet my second opinion dentist didn't see it on the x-rays after-the fact..The beauty is, the filling fell out just a few short months later. Fortunately, I went elsewhere, because I was fairly certain I'd be in for another root canal after the alarmist attitude Dr. Baker originally took with me.\n\nAnd, of course, I needed the same kind of over-priced deep scaling cleaning that so many previous Yelpers have complained about. My second-opinion dentist scoffed at it and stated that I had no signs of gum disease and it was probably unnecessary.\n\nI would NEVER recommend this office.

They won't make it in this business when there are dental practices who care more about the patient than up charging and finding any way to make more money.

Impressions Dental has all the state of the art technology and amenities that dazzle any incoming new patient...but patients beware! This is 100% meant to distract you while the office staff and doctors con you into expensive procedures that are not necessarily needed or even medically accurate. \nI went to Impressions Dental for a chipped tooth. I had hope to receive a routine cleaning and a filling. Upon arriving at there offices, they took me for a tour of all the amenities and services before my examination. Then the hygienist began checking my gums for a deep scale evaluation. I'm 29 and have been very meticulous about dental care and fluoride treatments growing up. I knew that they were trying to sell me a cleaning I truly didn't need.\nI could look past that, it was when they did the x-rays I had a knot in my stomach. I was told I had 7 cavities and would need 1 root canal if not 2 root canals right away and they made it sound like I was inches away from having all my teeth fall from my skull if I didn't get this deep scale cleaning. Then the doctor mentioned that when I go to the Endodontist for the root canal I should have him look at the other tooth to see if I needed the 2nd root canal. But he was pretty sure that both were a must fix.\nSo, I met with the financial consultant to work out how much this would all cost. I made it clear I was only interested in taking care of one root canal right away. She was a fast talker but told me that the root canal would be handled by the Endodontist they worked with and the cap would be done by Impressions Dental. I was fine with this but it seemed to me that the whole procedure would not be covered by insurance. I must have asked a dozen times if this was fully covered by my insurance. I even ask my Mom (who was in the waiting room) to come in and make sure that this all seemed correct. She also told my mother everything regarding the cap would be 100% covered by insurance. \nWell, I'm sure you have guessed by now that it wasn't until after the procedure the next day did they say I owed them 500 dollars. I was in shock. We asked to speak with the Doctor who tried to explain away the mistake as a miscommunication and that \"he doesn't deal with the financial stuff.\" I called him out, who wants to go to a practice where the doctor is clueless about how his office obtains insurance money or charges its patients? It's careless and irresponsible not only as a doctor but a business owner.  All he could say was that this mistake was not his responsibility and that mistakes like that \"never\" happen. Well, apparently he doesn't know how to operate Google or Yelp because he clearly has not read any of the reviews where patients have also been through similar experiences at his office. Ask yourself; do you want someone with such little regard for how they conduct business working on your teeth?\nBut it doesn't stop there... When we got to the Endodontist office for the root canal. He looked at my other tooth and said it was fine and had a minor cavity but it was nothing I needed to worry about for the immediate future. I asked if he was sure I didn't need a root canal and he replied \"oh gosh no.\" This got me thinking; maybe I should get a second opinion on my other teeth. If Impressions Dental couldn't tell if I needed a root canal, even with all his state of the art technology, what else could they have been wrong about?\nNot to mention, after the root canal during the capping process, the doctor at Impressions Dental poked fun at me for having my mother present. I thought this was extremely rude. I wasn't about to tell the man with a drill in my mouth the only reason my mom was present was because I didn't trust his office or his medical recommendation and it was too late to turn back!  I had just come from an Endodontist office that refuted nearly everything I was told 24 hours prior by Impressions Dental. Like hell was I going to sit in a chair and have him and his staff try to sell me the moon and stars in their orbits, while I was on pain medication from the previous procedure. \nI fully intend on taking my complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, BBB, as well as the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions. Save yourself the grief and find an honest doctor, Impressions Dental is just another doctor pandering for cash instead of providing quality care to patients.",

The bread they use is always so soft and delicious! Their pecan pie is huge (1/4 of a pie!) and pretty amazingly tasty.

This place is known for it's sandwiches stuffed with french fries and coleslaw just like the fat sandwiches from my college days. It is not known for it's ambiance, so let's get that out of the way and talk about the food. Primanti Bros has grown into a chain but I imagine all the stores look similar. It is a wood table and chair place with a nice old school looking bar. The menu is plastered all over the walls and you can only pay with cash. We grabbed a seat in the second section of the restaurant and waited to place our order.\n\nAfter a few minutes our waiter came by and we ordered. I decided to check out their #2 best seller, the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak, and a cup of their almost famous chili. Everything came out together and ready to eat. The chili was a seriously tomato based with a smattering of beans and meat throughout. I love chili and I love tomato soup and in my opinion this was a very good tomato soup. Don't get me wrong, it was a good soup but in the end I am privy to the texas style chili with heavy amounts of spicy peppers and a lot more meat.\n\nMy sandwich was also pretty good, some serious after drinking food. The bread was nice and thick which held up pretty well to the wet slaw and cheese. So here is when I admit my failure to read menus carefully. I thought that this would be a real cheese steak but I neglected to recognized the play on words in the name Pitts-Burgher. Instead of thinly shaved meat I actually got a burger on this sandwich. I was not expecting that and honestly didn't want it so my review is a little skewed. While the sandwich tasted good I was thrown off by the burger texture with the cole slaw and the non bun bread. The burger was also cooked all the way through which is not to my liking, as I am a rare kind of guy. I found myself wishing I had read more carefully and ordered the pastrami because this sandwich was not for me. Next time we are back in town I will try it again and order the meat I really like and judge it more fairly. I will say though that I have and always will love adding cole slaw and french fries to my sandwiches!\n\nIn the end this was a good restaurant with a strong following and I can see why. Cheap and sizable sandwiches for people going on or off shift or stumbling in after a long night of drinking. Pretty much the same reason why the grease trucks at Rutgers do so well but I will take my Fat Darryl over the Pitts-Burgher every time.\n\nOverall Review: 6/10",

Now one can grab a pastrami/corned beef monster sandwich before or after an ordeal at the Mart of Walls nearby.\n\nPrimanti Brothers sandwiches are often maligned, particularly when consumed at the original Strip District locale, but I will continue to vouch for the suburban satellites for they offer streamlined, more professional service, preparation, and atmosphere. Take your mother-in-law to this one and convert. \n\nBut back to that sandwich on the Italian bread, the one with the slightly sweet sauerkraut-ish slaw, the french fried tater blades, the tomato, the onion...the bacon???\n\nHence the beauty of the suburban Primanti Brothers restaurants: the menus are more flexible and expansive. If you don't like the slaw, you can leave it off. Do you feel like a burger, pasta, pizza, or a gyro? This Primanti's has 'em, and will bring 'em to your table on that custom, bakery tissue-lined aluminum cookie pan that always evokes sheer comfort. \n\nAnd, unlike PB's grittier urban establisments, here one can indulge in dessert. In this case, we went with their...bread pudding? Hell yeah, you can have some of that here (brownie sundaes and pecan pie are also on the card)! Topped with a potent Maker's Mark whiskey sauce and raisins, this tart, spongy, honeyed, wholly housemade end to dinner brings to mind french toast or Bananas Foster sans bananas, if that reads sensibly.\n\nI'm knocking off a star due to a slightly bitter aftertaste left by the slaw towards the last couple of bites. Was the cabbage cored before shredding? That faux pas aside, Primanti Brothers is a surefire way to make me smile on a wintery shopping trip, their sandwiches never failing to remind me why they are legend, clueless haters be damned.",

Simple - newer turntables have preamps which will interfere with the receiver's preamp -  and you have to flip a switch to turn off the TT preamp (hidden under the platter).

I have no issue with that except they are apparently shade tree mechanics. My car was towed there by the Auto Club who said even though he wasn't on the AAA approved list, he was good. This must have been his cousin ! He repaired a transmission seal on my car which became a disaster. Once I made it home on limp mode since he ruined a speed sensor in my car, the mechanic took photos of the lines they had cut in half and then re did with blue masking tape. I still have the photos. Don't go there for major work. It will be done by guys who are not true mechanics and do not even know that you do not cut wires. It was sloppy work and my transmission never worked right again until hundreds of dollars more were spent to repair the damage done. I was taken advantage of since I was a tourist.",

He asked me a question, \"Is the A/C on?\" I said, \"Yes sir, and that's the only time it overheats.\" He quickly diagnosed it by looking at the fan. lol  Nacho said my fan wasn't working therefor it wasn't supplying the radiator with its much needed air. He ordered the part. I came back an hour later once he received it and he installed the new fan within 25minutes. By the way, Nacho also spotted other malfunctions that my car has been needing attention but my usual mechanic never advised me on. Bye old mechanic. Hello new mechanic. :)\n\nI drove the whole day through this hot las vegas weather on my 1999 acura with the a/c full blast and NO MORE overheating!!! so happy. \n\nFast service, Reliable diagnosis, and will come back and refer friends.

On the way back to California, I passed by Las Vegas NV, and my engine temperature raised high, and engine red warning light was on. I realized I have over heated the engine. Since I believe the AAA truck driver is very knowledgeable about car and engine issue, I trusted his knowledge so I asked him (NOT AAA) to recommend a good mechanic. He recommended Nacho Mobile Auto Repair. Nacho (owner) told me that the engine block was cracked and was not fixable, he had to replace my engine with another used engine. It was a big job, so I went back to San Jose and waited for a few weeks. During that few weeks, Nacho kept me posted with my van's progress. Then, I picked up my Sienna, and drove back to San Jose. He even helped me and smog checked the van to make sure it pass smog test. I could feel that the engine that Nacho installed was good, and smooth. The power was as good as before, and transmission was smooth. But, since I want to make sure that the engine was indeed installed well, I had another very trusted and knowledgeable mechanic at Leader Auto Repair since 1995 in Santa Clara CA to double check the engine. Leader mechanic told me that Nacho did a very good job putting the engine together, and my van should be fine for a long time.  So, Nacho Mobile Auto Repair did a good job installing my engine, and I will definitely recommend this place to anyone with engine or car issues. Nacho is honest and he did not take advantage of my situation. The price is fair and reasonable even my mechanic at Leader Auto Repair would have charged about the same.",

We weren't able to pick it up until just before they closed and met him for the first time and noticed his small shop very clean and well  organized.

Great for first-timers and perfectionists!\n\nFirst of all, availability and cost were much more agreeable than any other place - this is the place with the best bang for your buck as I've found over 2 years of mulling over this decision.\n\nAfter hearing from Salon A (not its real name) that there were no availabilities for quite some time, I decided to throw caution to the wind and go with a place I knew to be good value from experience getting trims there as a kid.  Well, as it turned out, it was not only significantly cheaper (surprising when you see the aesthetic heaven that is the salon) but also I went in and right away they grabbed a handsome man who was off to get a bite to eat and on the spot he agreed happily and no question to take some time to work on me!   \n\nI have never had my hair coloured or altered much at all (just trims) as I've often heard suggestions to \"never do anything to [my] hair - it's perfect!\" and I know NOTHING about hair. But lately I've noticed it fading from the million dollar shiny spun gold it was when I was a kid to some strands that colour and others a dark honey/some even say brown so I figured I might try out highlights (full-head).  Going to other consultations, when I asked for an explanation of what full-head highlights entailed as a process I was given some runaround description that made it seem like they barely even knew what they were talking about -- how is that possible when they offer and perform it on a regular basis?

I hate hairCUTS nevermind how much I would hate a hair colour under normal circumstances.  I'm talking crying, yelling, alienating friends and family members - but there was none of that this time.  I looked like a better version of myself - not too different to regret and not too similar not to notice - and thus far my boyfriend who will tell it like it is and insult you and laugh if it's bad also LOVES it and hasn't had a rude word to say.\n\nOh AND he was completely pleasant - the conversation is not forced but consistent and he has some valuable philosophies to share like how to stay young and happy - though nothing out of bounds.  I would have paid 100 extra just for the compliments and TED talk!",

The place was pretty cool on the inside (see what I did there?), but there wasn't any activity going on in the rink so it's not like there was much to see. The restaurant itself was adequate. There are lots of TV's, including a private TV for each booth. That's neat-o, but unfortunately our private TV wasn't hi-def. So that sort of ruins that for me. Many of the others in the restaurant are hi-def, but apparently the private ones are not. So that means that you'll pretty much just watch the ones that are not at your booth. \n\nThere are some arcade games around, but we didn't partake in any of that. There is a lot of hockey memorabilia hung on the walls, including flags for what appears to be all of the teams. I saw the Blackhawks flag at least, so that's all that really matters.\n\nService was mediocre. Someone in our party ordered cole slaw as a replacement to the fries, but then still received the fries. We told the server and he brought out the slaw and didn't charge for the fries. Problem solved. We also had no problem getting our drinks re-filled. \n\nI really liked the fact that there were some healthy options available on the menu. I had the egg-white omelette and it came with a side of fruit. Tasted fine, but it was nothing special. The side of fruit was a little larger and more diverse than what is usually offered as a side a restaurants, so that was nice.\n\nAll in all, I would go back if there was an activity in the ice rink, or if there was a good hockey game on that I wanted to watch. Otherwise..... Probably not.",

I'll never make that mistake again.\n\nWhoever makes the pizza should be drawn and quartered, and after that, shown the door.

Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.  \n\nThe young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested \"extra-crispy,\" and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings (\"only the cheeseburgers have them\"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.\n\nThe happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.  I thought it something novel to be able to watch both novice and experienced skaters practice next door...  I hope I can bump up my rating next time.  That is, if I return.\n\n**Sister with two kids were coming for a visit in August, and I thought I'd take them ice-skating.

Our dumb waitress Jennifer was barely around and we couldn't tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks.  The manager i think he was, couldn't stop being a huge douche about the fact that I was the only underage person there.  He went out of his way to come by our table and say, oh yeah your waitress asked if I had checked your IDs before when you came to the bar for a drink, so I made sure to let her know that you (points) at me, were the underage one.  Well thanks you asshole, but pretty sure I ordered a god damn coke, and not a beer.\n\nWhen we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink, I asked for a coke, (this bar is about a 10 seater so you can see everything) and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks, and left me without a drink. Even though, I was sitting directly in front of his \"work area\".  Pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink.\n\nNow to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD.  The spinach dip was discusting too.  Didn't have any silverware, napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal.  Couldn't get a refill on ANY of our drinks.  I had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by, \"need anything else?\" and the glass is sitting right in front of her.  Uh yeah....She added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking.  Then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill.  All in all, everything was just insanely horrible.  Worse than denny's and sorry guys, but that means A LOT.\n\nLet it be known, we're in an economic depression right now, and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants, and as a server, you gotta milk every table that you're lucky enough to get as much as you can, because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good.",

I stood there at the entrance looking at the menu for about 15 min, still no one greeted me or acknowledged me, tho I was looking at each employee that went by, as if to say \"hey, here I am\", but they didn't  notice.  So I took the menu I found at the bar, and found a table and seated myself.\n\nThe flat iron steak I had a year ago, was no longer on the menu.  A server came within 1 minute.  I told her I was ready to order (after all I looked at that menu, while waiting to be seated, for 15 min).  When I asked her if the salmon was wild or farmed, she sorta winced and said \"It's frozen\".   When I asked her if the fish and chips was already battered and they pick ready-made pieces out of a box, and then fry, she said \"That's frozen too, but it is hand-battered the night before, then frozen\".  Weird.  She said it was pretty decent.  The description said it was a light beer batter.  It costs $13, plus she said the onion soup was good, with real cheese $7, so that completes my $20.   My server, Adriana, asks me if I want my soup now, before the entrée, and I yes, I am really hungry!  \n\nWe settle on water with lemon wedge, because I told Adriana I am diabetic, don't want any caffeine, or pop.  \n\nThe service was REALLY FAST!  But as soon as someone brings my onion soup, the fish comes right away too.  I look at each, wondering which to eat first, cos both are hot, and both will get cold at same time.  Melted cheese on onion soup is beckoning EAT ME NOW before cheese gets hard, and hot fried fish is hollering EAT ME NOW, before I get cold!  \n\nI eat the fried fish at same time as trying to gobble up the soup.  Soup is REALLY GOOD, very sweet, tho, I wonder if they put sugar in there, or is it just the sweet onions.  The swiss cheese was put on a piece of toast (crouton) and then melted, then both put onto the soup.  Much of the cheese was melted on the outside of the bowl, as well.  \n\nI was VERY HAPPY with the 3 pieces of fish.  The batter was indeed very light and very crispy, inside HOT!  I had to ask for some malt vinegar, which made it even better!  I substituted the fries (diabetic don't need white carbs) for the Caesar salad.  Salad was kinda boring, bland, so I squeezed lemon juice on it, which really livened it up.  Cole slaw was really good !  \n\nServer Adriana came TWICE to ask me if everything was OK.  She asked me if I needed a take out box, when I was half way thru my dinner, but I said I was really hungry and I think I will be finishing the whole thing.  And I did.  \n\nMy server was VERY attentive, genuinely friendly, helpful, and interested in my welfare (not distracted), and I give her A+.  If the management has more Adrianas, this place wouldn't get such bad reviews.\n\nI am giving it 4 stars because no one ever greeted me and I had to seat myself.  This also happened when I came here a year ago.  That server was not attentive at all.  My flat iron steak I had then, was really gamey, tho I like gamey beef, I wondered if it was American beef, as it tasted like it came from another country, South America.  So if it weren't for my previous experience with mediocre server, and if staff \"noticed me\" when I came in both times, I'd give 18 degrees a needed 5 stars.  Apparently people like it here, maybe cos it was Sat night, and not weeknight.  But every seat was taken, and different people asked for my three vacant chairs (I ate alone), and as soon as I stood up to leave, people were already sitting down at my table, before someone could clean it.

I was blown away!!! Our server informed us that it was \"buy one burger, get one free\" day. Being the burger lovers we are, we all decided to order one. It was one of the best that I have ever had. I might put it a step above Indulge Burgers...and I love Indulge burgers. I did the classic cheeseburger with cheddar. It was a 1/2 pound patty grilled medium and cooked perfectly. The server said that they grind sirloin, chuck, and brisket into their burger for a perfect flavor. Well a perfect flavor it was. I'm not sure what kind of bun it was but it held up great without being too bready. It was served with a smear of mustard and ketcup with classic L,T,O.  All I can say is that I loved that friggen burger. The flavor was just incredible. My buddy had the \"Bacon Blue\" burger and loved it just as much. We all had a great time. Pitchers of beer were cheap and they had a ton of tv's all over the place. I will certainlly return.

I had a living social voucher I think.. some type of social media discount. \n\nThe first problem they had with me, was that my voucher wasn't printed. Well on my iphone it clearly states, either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobile voucher. If you are not going to honor mobile vouchers then maybe YOU SHOULD PUT THAT IN THE FINE PRINT.\n\nAfter I made it clear they were going to honor this, they tried to tell me I couldn't use it for happy hour prices. Now I would definitely understand this too, had IT BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWHERE ON THE VOUCHER. Nope, nowhere. So our bitchy waitress goes to get her manager because clearly she doesn't have the brainpower to think of another excuse for not honoring this voucher....\n\nSo then this braindead manager comes over. He proceeds to tell me that he would be fine with using it for happy hour prices but the computer will not allow him to do so. I tell him to enter it in to show me that it won't let him & SHOCKER. It does let him.\n\nNow why on earth would a place try so hard to make a customer unhappy. Because to say I left unhappy would be a fricken understatement of the year. \n\nDON'T PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA VOUCHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ASSES WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT.",

The sliders I mentioned earlier are tiny individual patties that were black around the edges and chewy (like pucks), topped with a tiny piece of cheese on a bun  (no lettuce, pickle, flavor).  Their \"au jus\" for the burgers was served on the side and had no taste whatsoever, it wasn't even the \"salt assault\" style au jus that low rent places usually serve.  Mac and cheese was mushy and flavorless.  Fries were good.  Sweet potato fries never made it into the bag.\n\nOne common theme to all of the dishes was a complete lack of flavor.

Then I noticed the sign Goodlife E-Cig, my girl friend had been nagging at me to quit smoking for years so this year I figure this may be the best Valentine Day gift yet!\n\nI went into the store to meet Jian and Steve, they greeted me instantly and took the time to ask me a questions to make me feel welcomed. I explained my scenario and asked what E-cigs are, how it works, difference between it and smoking cigs. They took their time in explaining in fine detail, it was to the point I was worried I might have to pay for consulting services(which I didn't have to). Now that I was briefed on the introductory, I thought I could buy one of these things and walk out the door and I was persistent in just picking random battery, tank, flavor and the nicotine level. Normally when you say you want to buy something they give you the price and say thank you, Jian told me that since it's my first that I should take the time to find something I would enjoy and that would last me a while. I swear to god, Jian stayed by my side making sure everything was going well with the flavour testing, I forgot to mention they have 'chill zone' with a giant 60 inch tv right in your face so you can literally test out the flavors and watch a soccer game on a very comfy couch or sectional. Jian was very knowledgeable in people's preference and taste, after trying a few on my own, Jian asked which I had liked more and as he was asking questions he was passing me flavours upon flavours to try out and in the end he only suggest that I pick 1 flavour, seriously who does that? He later explained that besides running the business he actually cares and wants to help others quit smoking cigarettes as he knows how hard it is to quit. I got to give it to Jian, he truly is a wonder young man, after spending about 2 hours in the shop I walked out with a brand new 'KangerTech KBOX Mini Platinum', an 'aspire Triton mini' and 'Brew #88 Jasmine Milk Tea by Brewell Vapory-1.2%nicotine'. I feel like I actually wasted Jian's time and apologized, he smiled and said it was his pleasure and gave me his business card. This is true professionalism in retail/customer services. \n\nI rate Goodlife E-Cigarettes 5 stars and would recommend this place to any novice or professional vapers. I forgot to mention they have a station in the back for people to build their own \"mods?\" whatever that is... but there are tools and everything for you clean your tank, replace coils, etc.\n\nI want to thank Jian again for the tremendous effort, will be visiting you soon for a refill.",

I was ordering ecigs from the U. S. and became so frustrated paying the exorbitant currency exchange and S&H charges that I eventually started buying cigarettes again. I detest everything about regular cigarettes and my precious puppy got so upset whenever I tried sneaking a puff. Through Yelp and to my good fortune I found Good Life Ecigs which happens to be about a 15 minute walk for my puppy and me. \n\nAs mentioned, the service is fabulous with all sales agents displaying incredible product knowledge, delightful and welcoming dispositions, awesome assistance and refreshing patience when I asked about 100 questions. Another excellent perk is that Good Life Ecigs is totally dog friendly which is awesome as I don't go anywhere without my 6 month old puppy (the store has a lovely aromatic scent at all times). \n\nGood Life offers a huge selection of juices/liquids from delectable fruit & veggie, desert, cocktail, unique tobacco flavours just to name a few. The ambiance is wonderful with a comfy lounge area for customers to sit and try different flavour juices/liquids at their leisure. The prices are extremely competitive and my entire purchase including 2 great tasting liquids was less than anywhere else I checked in Toronto.\n\nI had an absolutely wonderful experience at Good Life Ecigs and I am looking forward to returning to try new juices/liquid for my new ecig, which I am thoroughly enjoying.\n\nI would definitely recommend popping into Good Life Ecigs to enjoy the store's wonderful experience and products for yourself. I know that I am thrilled with my new ecig unit. \n\nI love to patronize local Canadian owned businesses and giving my business to young Canadian entrepreneurs. Good Life is definitely an excellent choice in the ecig marketplace and I wish them success and continued growth. \n\nThank you from a verrrrry happy consumer",

I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong. \n\nThis place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.\n\nOnce inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order. \n\nI decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!\n\nAnd. It. Was. Heaven.\n\nIt's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added. \n\nAnd everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.\n\nI only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings.

Wow.\n\nSumming it down, it seems the #1 complaint is at Matt's (unlike Denny's) they have to wait in the hot Phoenix sun to get in or that the place is \"small\".  DUH!  If you go to a place that serves better-than-average food, and it is a small old historic place it's not going to be the same as squeezing your tubby stomach into a booth at Denny's and ordering an \"out of your mind\" $1.99 breakfast to make your butt even bigger.  In other words, if you like Denny's so much why did you go to Matt's?\n\nMake your choice ... pre-processed food from a mega-chain, or fresh food from local guy who works hard to serve locally grown/bought products and has gotten extremely popular because of it.  Small?  Are you kidding?  That's GOOD, not negative, how can you possibly rate a place bad because it is small?\n\nHate the Food Network?  Geez ... then don't go to a place that has been so highly rated.  Why subject your tender spoiled body to waiting in that \"miserable\" Phoenix sun?  People waiting in line means they know where to find great food.  BTW, my first few visits to Matt's were BEFORE Triple-D and it was and remains a place to go for people who have good taste.  And the complaint about having to go to the bathroom in the kitchen is pure BS - the clean bathroom is in the motel next door, not the kitchen.\n\nWe only have one Matt's in Phoenix and thank you heavens.  Is the food good?  Yes?  Is it fresh and uses the best local products?  Yes?  Is the service friendly and local?  Yes (if you're a tourist or Snow-Bird you just won't get this concept anyway).  Somebody believes the OJ is $2.50 for 2 ounces?  Really?  REALLY??  \n\nHere are a few personal observations:  I don't eat potatoes much, but I almost always finish Matt's home fries.  I am not a big bread eater, but I love Matt's fresh home-made bread.  Their eggs are local and bought by Matt every morning (he doesn't own a refrigerator or microwave at his restaurant).  The bacon on NOT what you will find at Denny's (a place you can walk right in to without having to spend 30 minutes of your precious self-consumed life standing in that horrid Phoenix sun). No, NO, I'm serious, there are actually tourists who reviewed Matt's and compared them negatively to DENNY'S!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhere Matt's really shines is not so much their excellent breakfasts, but the fact that they probably make one of the best Reuben Sandwiches in America.  Yes, better than Manhattan, better than that place where you chomp into a lot of fat and bread and pay twice as much for the privilege.  Not only is the sandwich great but the side of homemade macaroni salad is big enough to serve the entire restaurant.\n\nWant to avoid the 30 minute wait for breakfast?  Go to Matt's for lunch when the place is much less busy and get to know the people who work there and why their food is several cuts above most of what you will find in Phoenix.",

Each time, I've never wanted to wait so I went on my way.\nOne Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make.\nDespite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt's because of all the applaudes I've heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me.\nI had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt's and that's what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and I hate waiting!",

But their benedict sparked such a deep love that whenever I've been in a restaurant that serves benedict, I always get it, but it never measures up. Their fresh hollandaise, perfectly poached egg, delicious ham and wonderful english muffin... just cannot be beat. And then you have their oh-so-buttery hash browns that I crave on a regular basis. I used to have a problem deciding between their also awesome homefries roasted perfectly with rosemary, but now I can't resist the hash browns. Also, their bacon is absolutely heavenly, and I'm not really a huge fan of bacon, so I always end up ordering a side of it. The omelets and pancakes are also always perfectly fluffy and delicious, and I've never found their portions to be remotely small. I always leave completely fat and happy. My only complaint that I can think of is that their delicious orange juice comes in an insanely small portion, but their delicious honey lemonade makes up for it.\n\nThis is always on my list of restaurants I absolutely have to go to when I'm home from college.",

The answer: not.  You sign yourself in.  Once we had that figured out, we waited - but not for as long as I thought.  They certainly have an efficient little operation.  The staff brought out menus for any large parties so the kitchen could start in on their order before they were seated.\n\nOnce inside, we were greeted warmly and had our orders taken promptly.  My wife tried the special - an odd scramble of eggs, spinach and chicken sauage.  She got hers with hashbrowns and some really nice, thick, fibrous toast.  I had a few bites of her toast and was frankly tempted to order some for myself.  I thought the hashbrowns were OK, but I am not crazy about hashbrowns.\n\nI ended up with a bowl of their steel-cut oatmeal, which came with raisins and brown sugar (and milk), then got a side of the homefries.  Sure glad I ordered that side - they were the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked, with nice big chunks of potato, slightly blackened, with fresh rosemary.  Now, I am not always enthusiastic about rosemary.  Can be too strong.  But they'd added the perfect amount.  \n\nI commented to my wife that I could see coming there and having a couple orders of their homefries as my meal - they were that satisfying.  \n\nThe oatmeal was also very tasty.  I wasn't going to bother with it until I saw it was steel-cut.  It was my first time having steel-cut oatmeal at a restaurant, and I enjoyed the contrast to the typical restaurant oatmeal. \n\nSomeone at the next table ordered the pancakes, and they looked fantastic. \n\nService was very attentive and efficient.

However, after trying the food, I don't think it would be worth it to wait beyond 15 minutes especially during the summer months to eat here. \nTo start, the menu is a little too small and was missing some key breakfast essentials I thought. Biscuits and gravy... Hello? Anyways, I decided on the chick and chop meal with hash browns, over easy eggs, and sourdough toast. The chop was really dry and tough and at times, flavorless. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns, though really greasy, were some of the best I have ever had. The toast didn't taste much like sourdough to me but the home made peach preserves were pretty legit. My husband on the other hand liked the toast. I also ordered a small fresh squeezed OJ. Maybe its just me but I almost felt I would have rather had something from a bottle. Something just didn't taste right to me about the OJ. Lots of pulp, so if you like to chew your OJ, then you might enjoy it. The husband opted for the special: 3 meat scramble with cheese and fresh jalapeno's, hash browns, and tortilla. He said it was alright but was a little weirded out that one of the meats was bologna. \nAll in all, the prices were not too bad. We felt they were a little skimpier on their portions than other places particularly with the amount of hash browns and the toast. For a place calling itself \"big breakfast,\" I guess I expected more. Would we go back? Being that we are from Maricopa, this is pretty far for us to travel for breakfast so probably not anytime soon. The wait that is almost always present also doesn't seem worth it for a place that had nothing memorable to me other than their hash browns and peach preserves. Maybe if we are in the area and its not summer though...",

After all of the media hype over this little original were they going to be as good as promised?\n\nWe were thrilled to find that Matt's is very close to the Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central, so we took the train and didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot. A very good thing as it turns out as there are a few parking lots near Matt's but all of them were full.\n\nI had heard that's Matt's was small, but I was not prepared for just how small. One car garage small. Including the kitchen! This causes a major problem for hungry customers, the wait was nearly two hours! Wow, this place must be great if people are willing to stand out in the rain for nearly two hours to get in.\n\nOnce we were inside and seated things actually moved pretty quickly. We actually had food inside of ten minutes of ordering. The only con inside I saw really was how loud it was. But hey, I could live with that.\n\nThe food was very good. My wife had the Chop and Chix, a lovely seasoned pork chop, eggs perfectly cooked, home style potatoes and toast. I had a Salami Scramble, three eggs, Molinari sopresseta, hash browns and toast. It was all very good, very flavorful.\n\nHowever, after the hype and the nearly 2 hour wait to get in I was expecting outstanding not just very good. The other reality check item for Matt's was the price. I ordered a soda, $2.75, what I received was a 12oz can of soda. Yup, nearly twice the price of a six-pack of soda at any store in town for one can. A 4oz glass of orange juice, granted freshly squeezed, was also nearly $3.00. Hmmm, I didn't order any. \n\nTotal bill for our breakfast was $27.00 plus tip.\n\nBottom line? Matt's Big Breakfast has very good food, but only very good food. There was nothing exceptional here to justify all of the hype, there are many other breakfast places here in town with food at least as good if not better than Matt's for less money and without the marathon wait to get in.\n\nIf you go to Matt's expect to wait at least an hour, you will enjoy the food I promise.

It didn't just take the restaurant's staff members to provide customers' smooth dining experiences; the customers also knew the etiquette.

Both their breakfast and lunch menu items range from $4 to $8 - incredibly affordable.\n\nI ordered the five spots with home fries.  As the dish was placed in front of me, the smell of fresh rosemary had swiftly increased my appetite.  The home fries were buttery, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned.

But never judge a book by it's cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the 'hog & chick' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my 'hog' on to my hungry hog\n\nloving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I'm very picky on the poach... Not like it's a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I've never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn't test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It's presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It's next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I'll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I'm thinking I'm seriously picky with my breakfast/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I'm goin back to Cali..",

Great atmosphere in a city bereft of great atmosphere. Seriously. I asked the hot counter girl what there is to do in Phoenix. She seemed confused by the question. But at least she was hot. Yeah, sorry for even going there, but all the women who worked at Matt's when I was there were really friggin' hot, and I can't honestly say as an honest Yelp reviewer that it didn't count as a factor in the number of times I returned here. But what I can also say is that I wouldn't have gone near the place, hot serving wenches notwithstanding, had the food not been completely, utterly satisfying. Totally worth a drive across the \"city\" for. Really. I mean. Being from New York, I tend to compliment nobody. I enjoyed Matt's. So congratulations, management. You hired the right people. You cook a mean egg. You know what to do with pork. All of this was appetizing, satisfying, and filling. YUM.",

Ugh....after waiting over 30 minutes we got up to leave, I was hungry and the staff had now deserted us so we were going to leave.   At this time a woman, I can only assume she was the manager came up and said the food was coming.  We declined.  She said she could box the food to go, we declined.

            "text" : "Matt's Big Breakfast? \n\nI'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait. When you walk up to the tiny place (it looks like a miniature brick block that you're not sure is big enough for humans), you scrawl your name down on a standard piece of notebook paper... and then you wait. Not fifteen minutes. Not twenty. More like 60. At least they have free water outside because, let's face, even in October, the Phoenix sun can be brutal.\n\nPeaking inside, you realize why there's such a wait: about 8 tables (most seat 2 or 4) and about 5 stools at the breakfast bar. It's no wonder... If you do the math, the average person takes about 30-45 minutes to eat breakfast. So, add the ordering time... the cooking time... the debit card time... And you have about an average of an hour per meal. The odds are against you.\n\nBut, you put your name down, so you might as well suck it up. It's going to be a BIG wait for Matt's Breakfast. So, it's no wonder the food gets such great reviews. You're ravenous by the time your name is called -- you'd eat the fake flowers if you could away with it. \n\nCoffee is meh. At least they bring ya real cream. That's awesome. \n\nThe decor is minimal. It's said the color orange makes one feel hungrier. I really don't think Matt needs to worry about his patrons being hungry by the time they sit down to eat. Again, the wait is BIG. \n\nBut, I'll stop whining about that. Moving on... \n\nI ordered the daily special - a scramble with mushrooms and fotini cheese. It came with home fries and two wedges of cinnamon raisin bread. It looked very good when it arrived. One bite of the scramble and I thought, \"I could have made this.\" The home fries were bland... nothing like Kerby Lane's in Austin, Texas (if you've ever been, you know what I'm talking about... please, somebody wipe the drool from my face...). The redeeming piece was the bread. Granted, it's not the best bread I've had, but it was pretty yummy. I made sure to finish all that off, but I left 1/2 my scramble and all but a couple bites of my home fries behind. \n\nAs for the service, is was above average. Not extraordinary, like I somehow expected from a place like this that boasts the cozy feel of eating among friends. The service was prompt, though, and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that's hard to imagine when you've been on your feet since before 6 a.m. with a consistent rush. One of the cute waitresses even made people outside laugh with, \"We accept all kinds of payment. Cash. Credit. Check. Or you can work in the kitchen for a little bit.\" I thought her happy-go-lucky attitude was a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn conclusion... \n\nWalking away from the tiny place, I commented, \"I'm pretty sure I won't be going back there.\" \n\nFrom all the great reviews I've read, I had to try this place. I'm glad I did... it was definitely an experience, especially since the police showed up to deal with some next door squabble/drug bust/whoknowswhat. At least while I was waiting, I had free entertainment to occupy my time.",

            "text" : "Bacon? Outstanding.  Griddle cakes?  Crave-worthy.  Home-fries?  Awesomely awesome.  Service?  Ehhh.  Love this little joint tucked into a one-bedroom house!  The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes, BUT the service left something to be desired (more about that later).  My hubby got the three-meat scramble with hashbrowns, and it came with a tortilla.  He gobbled it down, apparently it was really good.  We never got any hot sauce, after two requests.  I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon.  The bacon was to die for, the best I think I've ever had.  The thick sourdough toast which accompanied my meal was served with real butter and fresh strawberry jam.  The combo was killer!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast!\n\nAbout the service -- The female waitress who greeted me at the door specifically told myself and two other parties that were waiting that they ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES, no waiting at the table for someone else to show.  She must have said this three or four times.  I pointed to my hubby, who was parking the car across the street and told her he'd be here in just a minute, and she reiterated, WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.  I was told to add my name to a list outside, even though he was 30 seconds away!  An older woman appears at the door and asks for a table, and tells the waitress her husband is parking the car.  \"Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now,\" says the waitress.  No \"WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.\"  No \"ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LIST OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS.\"  Noooooo.  Instead it's \"Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now.\"  GRRRRRR.  I piped up and said, \"Oh, here he is.  We're ready now.\"  The waitress responds, \"I'm going to get her a table, I'll be right back.\"  GRRRR.  I HATE people who say one thing and do another.  I was seeing red at this point, but the place is so danged small I couldn't tell my hubby what I was so pissed off about!!!  Anyhow, the waitress \"that wouldn't seat us\" buzzed our table once or twice, and I asked for water THREE TIMES before a very kind gentleman waiter got it for me.  They forgot my OJ -- he brought it out after I asked the other waitresses TWICE.  Hot sauce?  Never appeared on our table, even after two requests.  Just a tip -- the female waitresses were ditzy as hell.  Ask for a male waiter!!  (sorry if that sounds sexist, but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like.  This was NOT IT.)\n\nMy rating above is based on the FOOD (5 STARS) minus one star for the SERVICE (TWO STARS).  (I know, I know, five minus two is three, but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low, It was THAT GOOD)  In fact, I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes.  From a male server.  See ya!",

Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall \"amazing\" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........\n\nDon't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using \"local\" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. \n\nThe hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take \"over easy\" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. \n\nAll in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................",

The standout was their breakfast special of the day - a three egg scramble with white cheddar, hot links, and a pepper they described as in between a green chile and a jalapeno. Proably the best egg breakfast dish I've had in a while. As good as it was, though, I can't imagine waiting a half hour or more for it. Luckily we went on a weekday at a good time and had no wait, but I've heard people wait for hours for this food, and it's just not that spectacular. My other complaint is that, for a place with \"Big Breakfast\" in the name, the portions are no larger than what you'd get at Denny's or IHOP. I'm not a proponent of oversized portions at all - I believe it's wasteful and contributes greatly to our nation's obesity epidemic - but, come on, ya gotta live up to your name. Not only that, but some of the prices are a little steep. $2.50 for the tiniest glass of OJ you've ever seen. Service is great, the place is cute, and the food is good, but the media attention and national recognition on Food Network have overhyped Matt's from what it truly is - a friendly neighborhood spot to grab a good, fresh, hearty breakfast made with care.",

She was turned off by the flies and the heat inside the restaurant but did enjoy her tuna sandwich and potato chips.  The tuna was tasty - light, not too soggy, not too much relish or add-ins.  It tasted pretty fresh and the bread was delicious - definitely not just out of a plastic bag.  The chips were a little cool but the pepper was a nice addition.\n\nI've read complaints about the coffee and I'd agree it wasn't that good.  Not awful but if you're open to other beverages I'd say grab something else when you're there.\n\nI had two eggs over easy, whole grain toast, and hash browns.  The hash browns were some of the greasiest I've ever eaten (and I eat a lot of hash browns) but at least we're dealing with real butter and olive oil at this place.  The potatoes are grated really fine which perhaps adds to your ability to see all the grease.  They were greasy but tasty.  Still, the home fries on a plate nearby looked equally, if not, more tasty.  The eggs were fine and the bread was delicious. I had to order everything a la carte because the only two egg breakfast on the menu involved bacon.  \n\nThere are mostly 2 seater tables though they can pull up an extra chair to some of the tables but if you've got a larger party, prepare to wait. There's also counter space for people who are open to sitting at the counter.\n\nIf you go around 1:30 pm, there's definitely no wait! :)\n\nThe service was friendly though not particularly helpful.",

You never know. It's not important, though. It's so worth the wait. (weight).\n\nHaving tried a good portion of the menu, I keep coming back to the \"Salami Scramble\". It's one of those things you may make in your own kitchen and eat too much of when no one is looking.

It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.\n\nNow about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.\n\nNow for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.\n\nThe second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).\n\nBefore I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.

The presentation was definitely on point, the plate was full of fluffy eggs with melted fontina cheese on top. The rest of the plate was filled up with the country fries(potato). The bed of baby spinach added contrast to the plate. A dish that pleases the eye as much as the tongue. The andouille sausage/egg/fontina cheese was good combo. The flavor of all 3 really worked together, instead of fighting each other.\n\nHog & Chick w/ hash browns\nThis one was less aesthetically pleasing. But don't let looks fool  you. This piece of pork chop is mighty tasty. The hash was real good. They browned both sides of the hash, and added some other stuff. It was tasty and had good consistency. Wish the chop was a thicker cut. I'd pay more for a thicker cut.\n\nEverything here tasted good, and stood out from other diners. It was not expensive at all.

Also, our server was a sweetheart, very helpful and patient. \n\nTip- try the homemade berry lemonade if available\nTip- call ahead to find out about the wait- avoid the rush! \nTip- as mentioned in almost all other reviews, this place is very tiny- not a good for large parties or the claustrophobic.",

The maytag was yummy and fortunately I could taste it despite my scorched tongue.\n\nWe definitely left with full tummies (including my red burnt one) but more cons than pros means it was worth it to try for the first time, but I think the only item I might crave is the hashbrowns.

DELISH!  Do try!  \n\nI ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).  \n\nFor all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain. \n\nSidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand.",

Me and my sister ended up waiting an hour as the morning Phoenix sun started creeping up on us. We were able to sit at the counter which was awesome because I was able to see Matt cook in the kitchen. I ordered the hog and chick which consisted of scrambled eggs, fat slices of bacon, hash brown and wheat toast. In addition I ordered the orange juice which was freshly squeezed. The toast is freaking amazing! Best toast I've ever had! The homemade jam was tasteful because it didn't taste like the nasty jam you would get at normal diners. The hash brown was perfect! Crispy brown on the top and bottom and juicy in the inside. The hash brown was the best I've had because it wasn't dry which makes eating that much more enjoyable. The bacon... It was freaking delicious! 4 fat slices of bacon. Yum!

In the next five minutes, I'm pretty sure that every employee came by to apologize to us and ask if there was anything that they could get for us.\n\nWhen our food did arrive is was steaming hot and delicious. \n\nThe Chop & Chick was exactly as one would expect.

It was so good that I kinda felt bad about taking them up on their offer, but I decided that I'd make it up to them by going out of my way for more early breakfasts there.\n\nSo, was it a perfect breakfast experience?

That said, they're not the *WORLDS GREATEST HASHBROWNS EVERRRRRRRRRRRR*.  They're fantastic, but they are a bit mushy on the inside.

The waffle was really good!  It was definitely fresh and buttery.  The bacon left a lot to be desired.

There were a few benches that patrons can sit on & orange flavored water was offered outside for those waiting. \n\nThere was approx a 45min for out party of 4. Good thing we didn't come hungry.

They state they use local resources & organic foods. \n\nThe food was tasty. I ordered the griddle cakes & they were BIG. I had to ask for more syrup which they said they would charge us another $1.50 for. \n\nNo one in our party was able to finish what we had ordered.

Matt's is a KILLER place.\n\nMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.\n\nThe food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning! \n\nHere is what we had:\n\nPork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!\n\nThe next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!\n\nAs for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!\n\nOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.

It's actually a regular occurrence, while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches, for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait.\n\nThe place is small, you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat, but the food is second to none.  I always get the special, which varies from day to day.  It's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese, and some locally grown veggies or peppers.  I recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns.  If you're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes (seriously it's just all good), and if bread doesn't come with what you order you've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly...so delicious.\n\nIn addition to the amazing food, the service is always great.  Hands down, Matt's Big Breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop.",

My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.\n\nGreat value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn).

The menu features \"cage free eggs from humanely raised chickens\", grain fed pork and natural beef, as well as local organic produce.\n\nYou will only find a breakfast and lunch menu here, and the items are unpretentious and down-home - virtually anything I could easily whip up in my own kitchen such as BLT's, tuna salad sandwhich, tossed cobb, and burgers.\n\nAs the name infers, breakfast is big here.

(Personally, I feel American is the worst cheese in America, and I wish that government regulators would ban it from kitchen tables.) And when you add greasy grilled onions to an already greasy sandwhich with very un-American cheese, you get some bad bed-fellows.

I came prepared though, armed with my quiver of Lactaid pills. So bring it on, Matthew. I'm ready.\r\n\r\nThe food was great. Omelette was perfect and the home fries, seasoned with rosemary, were excellent. The griddle cakes were perfect for me, since I'm a big fan of the real maple syrup and light, fluffy flapjacks. My friends were fans of their hash browns, completely crisp and crunchy on the outside, and runny with butter on the inside. I'd never seen hash browns like this before, but I took a biteful to see for myself and the verdict? Really, really good.

Soft, fluffy, stick to the roof of your mouth goodness. The best pancakes I have ever had. Not to mention the maple syrup was amazing. Top notch bacon and the eggs cooked like my mom made them.

No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.\n\nThe obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.  \n\nIf you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.  \n\nThe food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.\n\nThe workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.  \n\nDo not let the wait deter you.  Go to Matt's.  Take every one of your visiting relatives and friends to Matt's.  Make a special trip from the far east or west valley to go to Matt's.  Just don't do it the day that I go.",

The food was generally good. Ham was tough in spots, and my meal was definitely in need of salt and pepper.The port in my breakfast special had no taste at all. Hashbrowns were somewhat burnt. I could live with this though. However, I had to mark this restaurant down due to the lack of comfort of the \"urban\" stainless steel stools that are provided to customers at the counters. Here I think style was a major concern over comfort, and I urge the owners in this eatery to sit on their own stools for an hour to experience the whole dining experience. While eating there, I spent most of the time trying not to slide off of these quite small, hard and slippery shiny stainless steel wonders, and since no rail to rest your feet on is provided, staying on them depends on you using the small rails along the bottom of the stool to try and stay on them. By the end of the meal, we couldn't wait to get out of there, just so we could stand up and stretch out our backs from the lack of support, hardness, and strain of trying to stay on these little torture devices. If the idea is to make it uncomfortable enough to keep the turnover quick at the counters, then they are perfectly suited for the task. However, we will strongly reconsider whether to return, and if we do, will never sit at the counter again. Good food is available all over the valley, and being comfortable while eating is also available all over the valley. \n\nAs a suggestion to attract and keep customers, I want to make a couple of suggestions:\n\nFix the stool situation. They are a big drawback.\n\nDuring the breakfast wait, instead of that watery whatever it is that you offer to all the people waiting outside (water? lemonade?), serve coffee. When the guy brought that out, many of us said \"Coffee, awesome!\", and then realized it was something far less appealing. By bringing out coffee and mugs (OK to use a variety from Goodwill or whatever), you will have an automatic coffee sale and people will enjoy hanging out while waiting. You can stage it from inside to control losses and offer it to those on the waiting list if you want, but it would endear a customer such as myself to the restaurant. \n\nWhen you put down the check, explain how it works. \"We can take care of this for you or you can pay at the counter\" would be helpful. We weren't sure what to do and had to ask.\n\nAs it is, we may or may not return to this restaurant. Might give it one more try.",

There was a breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, pork chop and eggs, pancakes, salami scramble, waffle, oatmeal and frosted flakes. Yes, you could order frosted flakes for $4.50. Why? I don't know. Nothing really appealed to me on the menu which was strange.\n\nI chose eggs over easy, bacon and hashbrows with toast. The bacon was phenomenal. This may have been the best bacon I've ever had. The hash browns were thinly shredded and very crispy but not burned in the slightest. The toast was thick and chewy with homemade jam. Everything I ate was excellent.\n\nThe service was atrocious. I ordered a coffee. I got one cup which was luke warm. I asked for a refill but that refill never came. I asked for water and that didn't arrive until the end of the meal. No one checked on us after we got our food. \n\nI heard they moved to a new place which is nice, industrial and modern inside (think Chipotle) but it's small. The lay out is also stupid and there is a lot of wasted space. \n\nEven at 9am there was a 1/2 hour wait to eat. I don't know if it's worth it.

Take a timetravel trip back to the 40's or 50's...there is an old motel and attached to it is this little, TINY diner. You walk up to the door and add your own name and # in party to the paper on the cart by the front door. Find a seat on a bench, if you can. Oh, if you have to park on the street because the lot is full bring some quarters because the spaces are metered.\n\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes. When you go in there is a counter and tables for two around the outside wall. There is at least 1 table for 4 in the back.\n\nI wanted to go here because they claim that they use all fresh ingredients \"No freezer or microwave\" and they use organic when possible. I saw the eggs being delivered and they were regular, not organic. When we were seated the waitress was right there to take our order. Since it was the first time we had been there we were a little slow, felt pressured because they want to turn the tables in this 7 top restaurant.\n\nMy hubby and I both ordered the \"local, organic apple cider\" at $3.95 per glass. It was an 8 oz glass so I felt that was steep! He ordered the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs were perfect, the bacon was limp- he asked for extra crisp, but it tasted good. The hash browns were a very large serving and crisp on the outside but very creamy, mushy on the inside, tasted good. The bread was homemade, 2 thick slices of cranberry walnut and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the waffle. It was a waffle, sprinkled with powdered sugar- which I can't stand and served with warm maple syrup. It came with 2 large slices of pepper bacon. It was all good, but with all the hype I was expecting more. \n\nI saw a woman at the counter eating what I thought was eggs benedict so I asked the waitress. She said it was but that they had just run out! Boo hoo! I would have really enjoyed that! She said it is their special every Thursday and to come back. Now, I checked the website before we went and did not see this special or any others. If it is a weekly special I don't understand why it isn't on the website so people know. \n\nI had to visit the ladies room. Now I have been to some out of the way places but this was really odd! You have to go out of the restaurant, into the hotel next door, wander down the hall...you can hear a tv, there is a no vacancy sign. There is a small sign for \"Matt's customers\", turn right (into a room) the restroom is a unisex bathroom in a hotel room. There is no waste basket for ladies and the hand towel is a real towel on the bar. It was vintage and clean but using the same towel as everyone else is NOT sanitary.\n\nI would go again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

I LOVE breakfast, and I am willing to wait for a good one.\n\nIt was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning, but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng.\n\nWe were seated after a wait of just under an hour and the waitress arrived promptly to take our order. My dining buddy and I both ordered the Hog and Chick, she with soft scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries, and I with over medium eggs, bacon and hash browns. We also decided to split a waffle. The homefried potatoes were good, but the hash browns were out of this world-- crispy on the top and bottom and soft and buttery in between. Seriously the best hash browns I've ever had. The bacon was thick and peppery, and lthough the waffle was tasty, I would have preferred it to have a crispier outside. The hand sliced whole wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam was perfect.\n\nI've been to a few places featured on Food Network, and though some of them haven't lived up to expectations, a few of them are home runs (Voula's Offshore Cafe, The Squeeze Inn, Bette's Oceanview Diner). Matt's knocks it out of the park.",

I love that Matt and his wife are so friendly and they always remember me whether I come into Matt's or The Roosevelt (granted, I AM pretty memorable).\n\nHowever...\n\nThe wait - it is out of control. Now I understand why Hawaiians hate mainlanders - because they have to wait at their favorite spots due to clueless tourists! \n\nHere is my solution, and Matt, if you read these reviews, seriously, consider what I have to say because I am in Mensa (not officially, but I would be if I took the test... I'm certain of it).\n\nSet aside a certain block of time for \"LOCALS ONLY\", for example, from 6:30 - 8:30 only locals are seated. How does one weed out locals from the lemmings in Tommy Bahama shirts and cameras standing outside? Easy. You must have a card that is punched each time you eat there, and once you have received 5 punches you are considered a local (granted, the first 5 times you go you will be treated like a tourist, but if it's your first time and you're a local, well hell, you're a tourist in my book). Once said card carrying local is verified as legit, he or she keeps the validated card and presents it from that time on.\n\nNow, I can already hear all the naysayers finding fault in this idea, including you Matt. But here's the truth - LOCALS keep this place humming. Tourists are one time tricks, although they do contribute to sales, it is miniscule in comparison to the long term revenue generated by Phoenicians. \n\nSo please Matt, do something that is not pc, but is good for the people that take care of you - take care of them back, get the locals in before Mr. & Mrs. Tommy Bahama. This is an amazing idea, and some restauranteur will read this and do it if you don't, so be the first, be a rebel - locals will love you for it, they will cheer your name in the streets and name their first born after you. \n\nLove, \n\nBrandon\n\n(dictated but not read)",

I generally stay away from generic tasting food in an effort to make my calories count for at the very least and awesome tasting meal.\n\nEven the toast was awesome!

Suffice it to say that neither of us are slouches when it comes to knowing a killer breakfast when we come across one - and he makes a mean frittata himself and I make sublime homemade buttermilk pancakes.  \n\nI read about Matt's online (altho I must say that I somehow fortunately missed the  ridiculously pretentious and nit-picky (too much rosemary for your retainer??? Get a life!) \"yelp\" reviews) so we decided to stop by for breakfast after flying in to Phoenix this past Saturday.  \n\nAs much as we love a good b'fast, we both despise a long wait ... but hey, we had nothing better to do and struck up conversations with other waiting souls and paid a visit to the nearby flea-bag Coronado Motel to use the restroom and soak up the atmosphere.  Matt's provides a cooler of flavored water and the time passed pretty quickly.\n\nIT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!  It's days later and I can still taste the perfectly light and fluffy (neither undercooked or overcooked) omelette, brimming with top quality cheddar cheese (who could imagine a basic omelette could taste so heavenly?).  The home-fries were bursting with flavor with the addition of rosemary, onions and peppers ... and the toast ... oh the toast ... homemade sourdough cut into thick slices, toasted and served with homemade jam.  My partner's special was eggs blended with some kind of slightly spicy sausage and cheese.  The coffee, too, is perfect, neither too strong or too mild and served with real cream and raw sugar.  \n\nService is fast, friendly and we were treated to the owner's adorable son seating guests and advising of the day's specials.  \n\nDidn't need to eat again until dinner - if you're in Phoenix, ignore the \"yelp\" twitwits - you simply MUST visit Matt's Big Breakfast.",

Matt's Big Breakfast was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!\n\nB R I E F  S U M M A R Y\n-- Probably the most reviewed/well known place in downtown Phoenix\n-- Featured on TV like everyone else said\n-- This newer location is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)\n-- Warm & welcoming ambience\n-- Friendly and attentive staff (seems like they have a system)\n-- I recommend coming early, only 6 tables @ 6:45am (Wed morning)\n-- Salami scramble was definitely unique but needed some cheese\n-- Potatoes had decent flavor (rosemary) but I wish I got hash browns\n-- Waffle was hot & fresh & syrup was high quality\n-- Sourdough toast was thick & good\n-- Strawberry preserves were delicious!\n-- The regular menu is very limited\n-- Staff recommends trying the specials\n-- Very sad I couldn't try the french toast, it's ONLY a special! :(\n\nWell I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck here and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an hour ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made it here at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old location but luckily I saw the new location was only a block further.\n\nI really like the feel and ambience of Matt's Big Breakfast (MBB). The wait staff were all ladies and they were all very friendly and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come here again so I ended up ordering basically 2 dishes so I could try 2 things. My server loves the waffle so I had to get it. The special she also recommended but I'm just not a fan of apple sausage so I opted for the salami scramble. \n\nI'm from the San Francisco bay area so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with fresh, local ingredients. I applaud them for keeping their food quality so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to it. I expect to pay a decent amount of money for high quality food. I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the prices were about right in my opinion.\n\nThe waffle was above average and I could taste the quality of the syrup. I really wanted the french toast but it wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french toast, you should offer it on your menu! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative. \n\nThe salami scramble was so unique and different. I've never had anything quite like it but I really wish they would have added some creamy cheese to smooth out the salami after taste. I think I added some ketchup or hot sauce to my potatoes and it helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't order again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough bread was so thick but it was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of it otherwise it would been just too much bread for me.\n\nClearly this place is living up to the hype as it is the number 1 rated place in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or anything. I would definitely recommend coming here and if I'm ever out here again, I hope that I can grab some of their french toast!",

Listen, it's not terrible...but it's just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a \"hot spot,\" but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It's small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I'm done with this place.",

Now - that being said, I usually go to a place just down the street (don't know the name, but it's a 30 second walk to the south from Matt's) and have a bloody mary inside (or you can get coffee, juice, whatever) and do my wait there while reading the paper.  So, this works for me - no big deal.\n\nOnce seated the food is simply great.  If there's a better restaurant serving fresh, sometimes creative breakfast fare in Phoenix I'd love to know about it.  But, as a Phoenix native, I haven't found an equal yet.\n\nI usually get the \"five spot\".  Simple, delicious and reasonably priced.  I've had the specials from time to time and they've always been good to excellent.  The service is attentive and friendly.  And, as someone mentioned, the juice serving might be a bit on the small side - but it's always been enough for me and I'd prefer the excellent quality over 8 ounces of something average any day of the week.\n\nSo, take your favorite paper, prepare for a bit of a wait, enjoy the great weather (much of the year) and enjoy.",

Until now.  After meeting a friend at Matt's for breakfast this morning (and waiting about 30 minutes) I can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  The food isn't gourmet or even creative, it isn't supposed to be.  Rather it's classic breakfast done to perfection.  Exceptional pork, eggs, potatoes, breads, everything.

It seemed like a nice place to eat based on the reviews.\nThe restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown.  Free parking is difficult to find so bring change for parking meters that are in abundance.  We arrived at around 9 in the morning and it was already warm, and yes there is a wait outside.  There is also not much shade other than a couple of umbrellas and the overhang.  I can't imagine really long waits.  By the way, don't go inside to sign up.  You put your name on a note pad outside of the door and they'll come out to get you when it is your turn.  Our wait on an off-day was about 15-20 minutes.  (Update:  Looks like they have moved).\n\nThe room for us inside was counter-seating next to the register.  It was a tad bit cramped and we didn't have a lot of space to wiggle since we were dealing with servers passing by us constantly.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  All the servers seemed like they were college co-eds but they did not lack any kind of customer service quality.  They buzzed around with purpose and had no problems with menus, rude customers, or getting around the cramped quarters of the establishment.  \n\nThe food is excellent.  We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best I've tasted.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious, and the side of pepper bacon complemented everything perfectly.  The star of the meal is the home fries; an amalgamation of potatoes, buttery goodness, and rosemary.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.  \n\nOverall the experience at Matt's was excellent, and maybe the new building will allow for better parking and less wait time.  And while the food was outstanding, the conditions for waiting, the parking, and the cramped spaces inside only warrant 4 stars.",

I knew there could be a weekend wait and with some toast in my belly I braved the hot noon sun. Located next to a sketchy hotel/residence space (hash browns AND heroin!), this small space is DAMN small. A nice walkway with cacti and rustic fence create a lil space, and dumps you into the counterspace/dining room. First impression-this place is WHITE-I mean, like the walls are white, the counter is, the seats are re-upholstered vintage chrome stools white, but the tables are a beautful blood orange formica-oh yeah, I like that...with lil' orange gerber daisies. Like so, cute.\n\nWe thought about sitting at the counter, but with a chance for shortie chairs, we went next to the window that actually gave a promising look of artsy downtown PHX-def. added to the experience instead of what I would consider a dreaded smooshed in one in the small room in the back (is that where bad people go to eat eggs?). After some confusion over why one would need water AND iced tea, I got to sample their coffee and orange juice. Man, I LOVED that orange juice-simply the best. And the coffee was good black, always a test of quality. The menu is small and due to the lack of veggies with the breakfast (does cheese count as a veggie?), I went with sweet instead of savoury. I got the belgian waffle (an option of fruit would have taken this to a whole 'nother level, btw) and WOW-but-ter-ry. I think made with real buttermilk too. With butter melting on top. Was the maple syrup made with butter too? Possible. I think maybe all of Matts Big Breakfast may be made of butter...mmmmm. It was so rich I really had to leave one lone piece on my plate. I could not eat it. Really. COULD NOT-immediate expulsion from the clean plate club. Totally ashamed of my inability for the MBB money shot.\n\nNice asides: \nThe taters are with caramelized onions and rosemary sprigs-HOLLA.\nI asked to have the bacon substituted with the afore-mentioned, and the waitress said that wasn't possible-but she did deduct buck and some change from the price of the waffle, which as a veggie I deeply appreciate-CLASSY\nParking lot and parking on street.\n\nBonus: Cute children will linger around your table and smile, much like nervous men at bars with bottles instead of beers, and not say much, making your experience alternate between unbearably cute and creepy.",

I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.  \n\nThe restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.\n\nSo, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn't get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn't tast whatever they used.  I didn't understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.\n\nHungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can't handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt's for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt's.",

After waiting about 45 minutes, we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats, when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables, completely set with silverware and everything. We asked if we could be seated there instead, but were turned down by the host, because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party. My husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs, so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit. Again, we were turned down. I was getting a little flustered, not the way you want to feel on your loved one's birthday. We considered leaving, even after we ordered our food. Eventually, they did allow us to sit at a two-top, which I appreciated.\n\nThe food was the only redeeming quality, but again I was too flustered to truly enjoy it. I got the cheese omelette with hash browns. Very good, although hash browns were a greasy, mushy mess. My husband got a ham scramble of some kind. We had a side of rye toast, which was tasty. Beverages were served in cute little jam jars.\n\nPROS:\nFood, Decor, Charm, Ambience, Supporting a local endeavor\n\nCONS:\nThe most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant I've ever known.\n\nThe take-out option sounds nice, and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations.",

Although the cup is small and I swore I can chug the OJ in 3secs but it still worth it! The porkchop was excellent! My whole wheat bread was thick and tasty! My scrambled eggs and fries were perfect! And last but not least, the additional bacon that I ordered was great! The only complaint that I have for this place is just the service. My waitress was too busy talking with 2 college guys customer that over-flirt her so she forgot we already gave her our card and wait for almost 45 minutes just to finish the payment. Overall, I will definitely be back for my superb breakfast but hopefully I will get a fast service next time ;))",

            "text" : "http://stevelerer.com\n\nI traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.\n\nThe restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.\n\nThe last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.\n\nAll in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.\n\nOverall Review: 7/10",

The hash browns, crispy and buttery.\n\nWhat I did not like is getting FLAT OUT RIPPED OFF with the TINY, TINY glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice they offer for $2.50.  I mean it's literally only about 3-4 ounces.  Tiny.  Grossly overpriced.  It's like they priced it like that to DISSUADE people from buying it.  Hate this about Matt's.\n\nPros:\n\nFresh, local ingredients, well-prepared and tasty.\nMany people say this is the best restaurant breakfast they have had, or among the best.\nPeople LOVE the buttery, crisp hash browns, and the home fries get a lot of praise also.\nAlthough the wait can be long, many people say it's totally worth it.\n\nCons:\nThe wait can be soul-crushingly long.

I am so glad I went!\n\nService was friendly and lightning fast!  I went with the recommendation of the server, and got the special: 3 Eggs Scrambled with Wisconsin Cheddar, Chipotle Sausage, and fresh jalapenos.  So simple and so fricken good! OMFG!  The fresh jalapenos were so spicy and yummy!  It also came with hash browns.  I know this is a simple thing, but, seriously, I've never had better hash browns in my life. I also had to order a side of bacon and am so glad I did. YUM!  Good coffee to go with all this too.  \n\n\nLater in the day, the hubby got out of his meeting early so we went to grab lunch there!!!  He loved the Reuben: its flavor, quality and quantity of meat, etc.  Had more hash browns and bacon =)  and tried the waffle. Tasty!\n\nI would go here every week if I lived here. Matt's really has a commitment to local, fresh ingredients and it shows in the food and how buy this place can get!  Am so glad I didn't have to wait for a table though...",

They have a very small menu but it certainly covers all of your breakfast needs.\n\nI opted for three sides, a pancake, rosemary homestyle potatoes and rye toast with jam. I asked my waitress which to order, the hashbrowns or the homestyle potatoes and she steered me towards my final choice. I'm glad I listened to her as they were delicious, covered with onions, olive oil and rosemary, the were cooked perfectly. They were some of the freshest potatoes I've had for breakfast in a long time. They weren't greasy at all. I felt like I had just gone to the Farmers' Market, chopped these up and cooked them myself for a Sunday brunch at home.\n\nThe pancake was good, nothing outside the ordinary. You can tell by the photo that there wasn't too much love in making it. For some reason the syrup was very good, I'm not quite sure what they used, it was a pancake syrup but obviously not the generic diner variety. The rye and jam were fantastic, just look at how thick the slice was cut, I've never seen a rye like that. I wish other places would serve their breads like this. I'd be a huge fan of any place that cut their slices in this manner.\n\nI would certainly go out of my way to eat here again. The staff were terrific, the place was spotless, the owner walked around and spoke with all diners (it seemed like everyone was a local) and the food was great. The prices have risen, at least since their website has been in place but it's still a good deal (the $5 Spot is now $5.75). A great place to grab a Big Breakfast in a nice atmosphere.\n\nI have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.",

The doctor's visit went well and my spirits were high. Surgery was not an option. For now.\n\nA few minutes later, my host arrived in a green VW Rabbit. I love the new rabbits. She needed to get some work accomplished and I needed to address some email. A few (Phoenix) minutes later, we arrived at the coffee-shop. I ordered a mug of coffee and picked up a business card. Lux? That sounds familiar... Oh my goodness! LUX! I shot their first cover on top of the Smithfield at 5.30 on a Sunday morning in 2007 and the magazine was named after the coffee-shop in Phoenix where Mark and Cindy birthed the idea.\n\nThe world is tiny.\n\n---\n\n\"My work is done. You wanna get breakfast?\"\n\n\"Do you even have to ask? What was that place you told me about before I left Philadelphia?\"\n\n\"Matt's. But there's another place I thought of that you might like as well.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah? What's that?\"\n\n\"The Welcome Diner.\"\n\n\"Lemme find it on Yelp and I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"This is hard. I can't decide. Let's just go to Matt's. I'll do the Welcome in the Spring when I come back.\"\n\n---\n\nThe West is a unique place. The cities are different - spread out. The architecture is different, too. I can't describe it. It just feels like it belongs here in the desert. Form over function. Matt's fits in just this way. It's tiny inside and everything's painted white. A few photographs in white mats with white frames take up the rest of the wall space. The small bar occupies a quarter of the main dining area and four diner-orange tables decorated with desert plants take up the rest of the crowded and intimate space which is by now teeming with locals who're there to gather a late morning brunch.\n\nThere were two specials that morning and once our server mentioned the first, I couldn't remember anything else, but I told her that I needed some more time so that I could neatly arrange my table for a shot of the menu. When she came back I ordered the three-egg scramble with red peppers, spicy sausage (all their pork comes from Iowa!) and provolone cheese. A side of shredded hash-browns accompanied this beautiful breakfast feast.\n\nFor a joint that stays as busy as it does, the prices are fantastic. (I think everything's cheaper in Phoenix). Before tip, my tab was right around $12 and for the quality and quantity of food that I received in one of Phoenix's most popular spots, I had no complaints.\n\nWhen I make a return visit to the Valley of the Sun in April, I'll be sure to make myself an out-of-town-regular at this wonderful little place.\n\n...And maybe next time I'll run into Nate Ruess.",

            "text" : "Breakfast - the most important meal of the day and the best, especially if you get it at Matt's!\n\nMy biggest dilemma at Matt's is only solved by deciding I can take home what I don't eat and enjoy it later.   Plus, I have to say no whenever I can to their yummy organic chocolate milk which fills me up before my food even comes.   It is truly hard for me not to get their omelets which are extraordinary.  I get basic ham and cheese and the buttery goodness of the eggs along with the \"real\" ham just make any other omeletes I have had just average eggs.  Then there is the frantic moment when the server needs to know if I want home fries or hash.    Ack!  Both are the best although I have figured out that I can take the home fries home pop them in a pan the next day and my house smells like Matt's and the potatoes make everything I make to go with them taste even better.\n\nThey have scrambles on the special board that often tempt me away and the beauty is that they put in what is fresh at that moment.  Everything at Matt's is fresh and they only use the very best.  My other addiction is to their pancakes which just blow my mind.  No matter what we get I tend to get one on the side to share with my husband as while I don't want to get just pancakes I can't turn it away.\n\nThe most incredible thing I have ever had there is the Huevos Rancheros.  I even had my name put on a list to be notified when they have them and short of a 3 hour drive back into town I will get to Matt's when they call!\n\nMy husband is a true blue chop and chick fan.  He can rarely leave the pesto crusted pork chop to order other things, and then he proceeds to nibble every bit off the bone which he assures me is the whole point of the bone.  He also scores my jam as I am not a jam person and according to him and everyone else it is awesome.  I have bought it at the market from the makers as gifts.  The jam goes on the bread which is another treat altogether. Sliced thick and perfectly buttered it also is good the next day.\n\nYes the wait is evil but you just have to manage it.  There is no doubt we don't go as often as we would if it were not long.  It is hard to go on most weekends as it is a 3 hour chunk out the day (for us drive time, wait time, and yummy time), but on Saturday's you can put your name on the list visit the market and return to find yourself top of the list.  Don't fear missing your turn for if you mark down you are going to the market they will put you back at the top of the list when you return if they already called for you.  My husband also ventures there during the week as a single and says he is seated within 15 minutes any time.  Please note he is a cruel man and he is told to keep his trap shut about these solo visits as my food envy thunders in.\n\nIt is a no brainer 5 star adventure at Matt's.  If the food didn't melt my brain with sensory happiness the adorable picture of the owners' son on the wall certainly gets my heart.  Matt and Erenia keep up the great work (and the cute aprons :-))!",

They are seriously, one of the most delicious things ive ever eaten. I got the Chop & Chick.. because i love pigs and eating them. The pork was perfect, nicely seasoned, tender and delicious. I got my eggs over medium, because egg yolk is one of my favorite things to dip shit in, and an order of home fries because the waitress said the hash browns were \"kinda funky, not like usual\", that day.. but she lied. or maybe she didn't, but my friend got them and either way, they were amazing. My friends got the 5 spot (breakfast sandwich thing) & the daily special (some chorizo mexicany mash up of yum), which were both equally amazing, but for real, my yolk covered pork chop superseded anything those fools were eating. Its been on my mind for days.\n\nAs usual, I drank way too much coffee, but what I should have done was order a chocolate milk like my good friend Georgie S. had.. For whatever reason, it was better than any other chocolate milk in the universe.\n\nIts small, cramped, kinda retro, no booze and there is no bathroom.. but whatever, I like places like this. its totally worth it, and did I mention its CHEAP?!\n\nGo here at least once in your life.

Being that it was a weekday and close to 2pm, the restaurant was nearly empty and we didn't have to endure the wait or the harried service. In fact, other than a mix-up with toast, the staff was attentive and eager to please (or get us out so they could go home).\n\nI ordered the jalapeno burger with kettle chips and Jules got the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs with bacon. Her hash browns were buttery and sweet.

My brother loves it.  Similar to a Royal Red Robin Burger, but obviously superior.\n\nThe only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast.  Bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait.\n\nSimply put, this place is amazing.  I am so lucky to be so close to this place.

Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\n\nSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\n\nSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\n\nSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\n\nMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of \"The Chop & Chick\" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)",

I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!",

            "text" : "In the movie \"The 40-Year Old Virgin,\" there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: \"You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!\"\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked \"What's the probable wait time?\" We were told, \"Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times.\" The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. \n\nThen this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said \"Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now.\"\n\nI just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.\n\nI'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the \"traditional breakfast food\" so \"different.\"\n\nI ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.\n\nThe omelette was more like \"Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese.\" The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?\n\nI'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to \"go there\" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?\n\nIt was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely \"real,\" which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats \"Moons Over My Hammy\" for instance.\n\nBut we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.\n\nThe bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said \"That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there,\" while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.\n\nMostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. \n\nI might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.\n\nThe \"thick-cut bacon\" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.\n\nI see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say \"Eggs!\" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT \"The Best\" and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.\n\nThe chalkboard on the wall inside says \"Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner.\" I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.\n\nI'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.",

While he was waiting he went inside and asked for a cup of coffee.  He was told that they only sell coffee with to-go orders, so he asked for a coffee \"to go\".  He was turned down, so he walked across the street to the farmer's market and bought some coffee from a stand.  When our table was ready, they made him stand outside to finish his coffee because they have a strict \"no outside food or drink\" rule.  Pretty lame.  As far as the food, I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and fontina cheese.  My husband had an omelet with hard salami.  While the food was good, it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.  The star of the meal was the locally made fresh strawberry preserves, but nobody told us that was coming and it didn't go too well with my husband's sourdough toast.  A heads up would have been nice.\n\nI think part of the allure of this place is the fact that there is almost always a crowd of people waiting outside.

The omelet was huge and so were the ingredients. The peppers which I thought was be sprinkled in like most places was actually a whole sauteed pepper. The ham was smokey and thick.

No wait or parking issues. I ordered an egg salad sandwich to go. Which was delish, BTW and the Homemade Mac salad was outstanding. So, my foodie fingers type, What's the big deal?

The place is small, like previous posters have alluded too.  You don't get how small until you actually go.  10 tables and 7 seats at the counter, tops.  The waits can be long and now I know why.\n\nSo we were a party of 8.  The parents sat at a table and the \"kids\" sat at the counter.  The menu is simple with not a lot to choose from.  I heard the pancakes were great, but I like a little more substance with my breakfast.  I chose the special, 3 egg scramble with bacon, cheddar, and fresh jalapenos, rosemary home fries and a tortilla.  Not being a huge jalapeno fan I almost had them nixed from the order, but decided to go with it.  Glad I did.  It was great and the peppers added a nice little bit of heat.  The rosemary home fries were outstanding!  I know all of this sounds very simple and you could probably make this at home, but it always tastes so much better when someone else makes it!  \n\nI think this place is worth the hype!",

I sat at the counter.  It's impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won't let you sit at a table, so you're stuck at their crappy counter.  (don't get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)\n\nOne of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren't that remarkable.\n\nMatt's won't be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I'll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.

It was delicious! My husband had the salami and egg scramble with hash browns and LOVED it! This is our new favorite breakfast spot!

Score!\n\nI ordered the insider burger (not on the menu) and it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! How is this possible, you ask? First off, the meat is cooked in butter. You heard me right. Butter. Second, the burger is topped with 2 eggs AND bacon. As if this weren't enough to convince you, it comes with a side of homemade chips and a pickle. Love it! I didn't even care that my face was covered in egg yolk.\n\nIf you're more in the mood for breakfast, Matt's has plenty of options.

Your bottom will be very sore from sitting so long. This restaurant is in an old lobby of an old motel. You know, the old motels with the little detached lobby the size of a one car garage. I would not recommend bringing a group here...they will not be able to fit you.

It comes with toast and your choice of hash browns or home fries. The chop was smaller, not life changing, but very tasty...it had great seasoning. Only $8 too. Home fries were a five out of five. Very good! No soda machine here...they sell RC Cola by the can though. $1.25 a can...My Dad had the griddle cakes and he said that they were the best pancakes he's ever had. So funny because we talked to a waitress and she said it's just a regular batter but my dad is a pancake connoisseur and he loved them!

The top layer of hash browns were crazy crispy which is always a good thing. But beneath the crust were some great gooey gluey but not soggy potatoes that perfectly complimented the crisp of the outside. The crisp:gooey ratio was flawless!\n\nEven the toast was fantastic. Went with sourdough. Always do and forever will. The jam was made with fresh berries. The toast was thick and well-buttered. Went great with the freshly made jam.\n\nAll-in-all it was a good breakfast experience. It wasn't the best breakfast in the world. It wasn't super phenomenal or mind-blowing.

The place is very small, it reminds me of a very casual, good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food.\n\nWe put our name on the list outside. For a party of two, our wait was about 30-45 minutes. It was long but it didn't feel too long. It was a hot day so we waited in the shade. The hostess that sat us was very nice. We sat at the bar. My friend ordered the scramble special and I decided to order the Chop and Chick with wheat toast, hashbrowns and over easy eggs.\n\nThey served water in a little jars which I love. It's so cute and it reminds me of a simple, home-cooked. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, it seems like couples like to split the food because the portions are big.

If you take a big party, you should be ready to wait a bit longer.  The food is always done great, and they have a daily special.  The ingredients are part of the success, and they use local fresh organic ingredients in the food.  The waffle is the best on that I have ever had in my life.  The eggs and ham or bacon are mucho terrific.  My cousin is a fan of he chop and eggs, and that its two healthy pork chops with eggs and sides.  I have eaten most of the stuff on the menu, and there is only one clunker in my book.  that is the home made potato chips with lunch items.  They are a little heavy for my taste, and its would be nice to see fries with stuff like a huge butter burger.  Sample the organic lemonade, and you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is close to the light rail, so you could go there on that, and parking is limited.  Visit Matt's BB and you will be back without a doubt.  This is the kind of place that is more old school, and if you want a lot of space and don't want to be close to your fellow diners, you might not like the dining experience.

The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you'll be honest to admit that there's far better elsewhere.\nAs surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees.\nMe thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt's menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it's all fake kissy-kiss talk.  \"Phooey!\", I say.\n\nThe most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I'm saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... \"coffee\".

Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn't everyone have a knowing that if you're going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it's the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt's will hear none of that; they don't seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don't return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who'd commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.\n\nThe servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I'm talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot.\nNonetheless, give Matt's a try at least once.\nAt least.\nBut, pass on the coffee... or, \"Don't go into the light!\" as they say of near death experiences.",

Special today was Eggs Benedict with choice of hash browns or home fries.  I normally don't like poached eggs but thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I did.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious, the canadian bacon was very flavorful, nice sized english muffin and I choose hash browns which were soft and moist but a little too dark.  friend got the 3 egg salami sopprosata omelete (sure spelled wrong) with hash browns and oj.  the homemade, organic strawberry preserves they serves with his toast was amazing.  not too tart, not too sweet, just wonderful.  \n\nwill go back again, however, probably not during the snowbird season.  we were able to get right in this morning and we did hear some regulars talk about how it was nice to see so many people in there today, considering it's now off season for visitors.  apparently, as others have indicated, there can be very long waits to get in.",

Their honey lemonade is inspired and their iced coffee is pretty good too. \n\nThey are right across the street from the Phoenix Public Market and if you want to go walk around and see the shops instead of waiting outside (for an hour) you can write 'market' by your name and you will be seated next up if you get back after you've been called.

I'm all about supporting local business & breakfast is my favorite meal, so this past Saturday I decided to check it off my foodie bucket list. I met 2 friends at 10am. One of them had gotten there at 945 and put our name on the list for a table of 3. Almost 1 hour later, we were seated at a 2 top with an additional chair pulled up. To start, a hipster waitress wearing a huge gold watch and too many bracelets asked what we wanted to order after we had been seated for no more than 2 minutes. Menu-  I've been craving French toast all morning. Come to find they don't have French toast. \"French toast is seasonal\". Really? Waitress is back again asking what we want after an additional 2 minutes. I ordered a waffle that came with 2 pieces of bacon for $7.50. Waffle was good, served with real cream butter. They do have real maple syrup which is a plus. The bacon was thick, but peppered on the sides which I don't like. Maybe I'm greedy but I also think they should have given 3 slices for a $7.50 plate. I also ordered a cup of coffee (which admittedly I am a coffee snob). Ick.  Burned and watered down at the same time. Needing the extra caffeine, I got my coffee refilled once the cup had been empty for almost 15 mins. I actually asked a server passing by twice if they could refill it.  They never did bring the creamer I asked for (also twice) so I couldn't even drink the 2nd cup. All in all, we waited entirely too long for a crowded place whose food was nothing to write home about. Our bill was almost $50 including tip for 3 people. I recommend you skip this hipster spot that has been hyped up entirely too much. Simply doesn't meet up to expectations IMO. If I'm craving a hipster breakfast and am prepared to shell out $50 for 3 people, I will swing by Postino's for brunch on Saturday/Sunday and get a meal with fresher ingredients and much better coffee and service.

Just a little over-priced for the experience that we didn't end up getting.  \n\nWould I go back again?  Yeah, if someone came cross-country on a Fieri food frenzy and demanded it.

I recommend signing the wait list before you're actually hungry and go check out all the local vendors.\n\nI previously had the hog and chick with \"off-the-bone ham.\" Mmmm....the ham is always flavorful and just the right amount of tender. I love how the toast is actually hunks of sourdough or wheat rolls with jam that's not a little Smuckers packet. Back to what I ate this trip, I finally had their Belgian style waffle. It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. \n\nThe staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to.

            "text" : "The Place: \nAfter reading many of the hundreds of reviews talking about the size of Matt's, I was still surprised when I pulled up with my family and the restaurant was the building that looked like a small shed.  LOL.  Forget small, the place is micro.  It has a bit of an urban chic/diner-vibe, but there is nothing to the appearance that would make someone ooh and aah.  Our table was two tables for two, butted together with two chairs facing the window/wall, and the other two facing each other, an odd, but space saving layout.  We were in the first room where there is also a tall bar to sit and eat, however that bar is also part of the \"list\".\n\nThe Food:\nI ordered the Hog & Chick with scrambled eggs, bacon, wheat toast, and home fries.  The bacon was as good as most have commented, a little sweet, smokey, and peppery.  The wheat toast was thick-cut and super grainy and served with raspberry lavender jam, both super.  The eggs were fresh, but just scrambled eggs.  In my opinion the highlight of my dish was the home fries - these potatoes were cut into chunks and fried with fresh rosemary twigs and onions.  I thought I needed ketchup for them, not hardly.  My wife tried the pancakes and wasn't particularly impressed, nor was I when I tried a bite.  They were okay, just not amazing.  Since there is no kids menu (which is an oversight in my mind) my older daughter ordered the waffle.  It smelled great, and she polished it off before I could get a taste.  I thought it looked good - and she said it tasted great.  Nice touch is that both waffles and pancakes come with REAL & VERY HOT maple syrup.  My other monkey, er daughter, had the Hog & Chick as well, however she had the hashbrowns and country ham.  The ham was good, but salty like good ham should be.  The hashbrowns were REALLY soaked in oil/butter.  They were crispy on both sides, but whoa ... really soaked.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nWe got REALLY lucky in that we got there and were able to get seated within about 5 minutes.  This was around 8:30am on a Thursday, as soon as we were seated, the crowd showed up and there were at least 20 people milling around outside waiting to eat.  The parking stinks, micro lot behind the restaurant, and other than that it's metered parking.  $.60/hour is still cheap though.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the experience was a little to crazy for my family of four with two squirmy kids.  I'm not a hater, but I'm not going to tell you it's the best breakfast I've ever had either.  The prices were fair, but again with a family of four with two small kids we tend to appreciate a place with a kid menu.\n\nIf it was only adults and we weren't so wiggly it might have been a different story.  I'm not sure I'm headed back there any time soon with my little wiggle worms.  That being said, you should try it and see what you think.\n\n(big plus is that they took AMEX - one of the few small shops that do)",

While we were waiting, a huge line started forming to the outside of the restaurant around 8:30am on a Friday. \n\nMy brother in law had the special of the day, which was a chipotle jalepeno sausage and cheddar scramble served with potatoes and a tortilla instead of toast. I ordered the Salami scramble. I liked his dish because the chipotle sausage was spicy and full of flavor! My Salami scramble was good, but on the salty side. The salami was cut similar to fries, in long rectangular thick pieces. For some reason, I expected thin slices, but it was good all the same. The \"home fries\" looked more like a hashbrown cassarole and were much, much better than the regular breakfast potatoes. The home fries were my favorite part about being there, more than the salami scramble itself. \n\nThe side of sourdough toast that came with my meal was impressive. The toast appeared to be nearly 2 inches thick, and that was a single slice! It was served with a savory homemade marmalade. \n\nThe owner and the servers there were very friendly, and despite the chaos of the line of people waiting and people constantly checking to see if a spot opened up yet, the staff handled it very well! That alone I give them 4 stars. \n\nFor being a big breakfast, I'd say that my dish was just the \"right portion size for me.\" For some place with big breakfast in the title, if the portion is just right for me, that means that the dish is on the smaller side. \n\nAfter telling about my experience to another friend, who adores this restaurant, I guess I was supposed to order the pancakes, because they are ridiculously good.

It is no surprise that even on a summer's day people sit outside in the heat and wait for a table.\n\nI'm surprised by comments about the service here because all of the girls came out to check on those of us waiting outside and even took our orders in advance so they would be prepared the moment we were seated. Everyone working there was very sweet.\n\nMy last visit was a sad one however because I was suffering from a brief but very severe hangover (what I like to call an Express Hangover) that was so bad all I could manage was a few sips of juice and coffee. If Matt's is in the future I have to make it a point to behave myself the night before because passing up such a great breakfast is a crime in this Yelper's book!",

Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn't sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I've been waiting like I said for \"2\" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you'll wait forever!",

That is patently ridiculous.  The only time someone cracks open an egg at Denny's is if you order them sunny side up.  Otherwise, they pour pre-scrambled eggs (as does IHOP) from a bottle.  The other comments I've read are \"there's nothing here that can't be made at home.\"  Completely true, but that could be said of a lot of restaurants.  The whole point is going OUT to eat when you don't want to make food at home.  Frankly, some of the lesser starred reviews would be much different if not for the long waits.  Anyway, I digress...\n\nLike many, I first became aware of MBB after it was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (DDD, Triple D, 3D, etc.)  It looked good, but nothing terribly special.  Certainly not like some of the places I've seen on DDD, which leave me checking travel websites for flights.  But, I thought, \"If I'm in Phoenix, I'll give this a try.\"  \n\nSo, I'm in Phoenix and craving breakfast.  I make my way down to Matt's and while there are 6-7 people milling about outside, it's not too bad.  After waiting maybe 30 minutes (downright speedy compared to the wait endured by some other reviewers), my name is called and I enter the tiny eatery.  The menu is pretty sparse, but there are some specials so I opted for one of the items on the chalkboard: egg, spinach, mushroom, smoked gouda scramble with hash browns and toast.  While I wait for my meal, I enjoy some of the very tasty coffee.  My plate arrives, and it is a large serving of food, contradicting the reports of skimpy servings.  As a lover of hash browns, I had to try them first.  Crispy and super buttery, just as I recalled when watching DDD.  The scramble was excellent and you could tell how fresh the ingredients are.  I decided to save my toast and housemade jam as my \"dessert\", so to speak.  I think my only issue was with the hash browns.  They started off so well, but it was a large portion and at the halfway point the richness of the butter started taking its toll.  I soldiered on and finished my plate, but I seriously thought I'd have a heart attack.  Sadly, did not have room for my toast and jam.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Phoenix again, I would come back.",

Of course there's a wait, it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state, and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week: because its really good food served by a really good staff. I'm sure that the people who complain about the wait here are the same people who complain about the wait at Pizzeria Bianco. \n\nTo all of those people, I pose this question to you: since when has dining out in America become this rush to get in, stuff your gullet and get out as fast as possible? Why is dining in this country no longer about the experience and the socialization you get with your fellow diners? Why not come downtown, sign up for a table, and then stroll down to Fair Trade for a latte while you wait, or take a nice walk around and see what the Roosevelt district has to offer? We're always in such a hurry...I say it's nice to slow down, spend some time with our friends and family and nosh on a breakfast that is totally worth the wait. I believe that many restaurants have spoiled the average American consumer with instant gratification--how many times have you refused to wait at a restaurant because the wait was 30+ minutes? We want good food, and we want it now, screw everyone else, and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes, we'll take our business somewhere else. This attitude is crap. \n\nYou have to slow down and appreciate how hard this little restaurant works. Matt's wife is there 6 days a week to ensure that their business is performing at the level at which it should. The kitchen staff is there from 6:00 am to almost 4pm sometimes churning out thousands of plates of fried eggs, thick peppered bacon, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, pork chops, burgers...The point is, a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff. \n\nIt is a small restaurant, but it's always warm and inviting, and the coffee is always hot and fresh and they might not serve you a huge glass of orange juice, but it's always 100% fresh, squeezed that morning by the staff. \n\nAfter my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant, I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place: the wait, the small serving of orange juice, the confined areas, and that's OK. All I'm saying is that this place is an institution in downtown dining...and it's really nice to go an experience the food, the service and the though that goes into running this business if only every once in a blue moon. And if not, that's OK, because there are plenty of people who will gladly take your place in line.",

I ordered the belgian waffle, which had sweet cream butter, sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side. It was served with a side of thick cut bacon, which I have never tasted like this before - it was peppered and tasted really good! I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs. Let me tell you, the food was good - I ate my entire breakfast! The staff was very friendly too. As I was paying and getting ready to leave, I noticed a stamp of Guy Fieri's face on the wall!

I had also saw the episode on Triple D with Guy Fieri and the dude raved that this was his fave. Now I had already put it on the \"must go\" list and then asked for recommendations. I was told to expect an hour wait, order the waffles or griddlecakes and the pork rib chop. Good info...\n\nIt was ambitious of us to want to wake up early to have Matt's, but we did eventually get there, even with the stoopid Android GPS getting us lost at First Ave and not First St. We had made a few passes around the block and saw the farmer's market diagonally from Matt's. I dropped off Kathy to put our names down, parked in the lot and headed over to the farmer's market. Now, you couldn't plan this any better, but the market is open Sat and Weds, so what better way to kill time, instead of sitting in heat? After about 40 mins, we headed back and got called immediately.\n\nWe got in and ordered waffles with a side of the griddlecakes, since Kathy couldn't decide. I went for the pesto crusted pork rib chop with home fries that were Yukon gold potatoes grilled with rosemary and onions and two eggs over easy. The batter used for both the waffles/griddlecakes were light and fluffy and when you factor in the homemade whipped butter and authentic Vermont maple syrup, the combination is Dyno-mite! My pork rib chop was tender and moist and the Yukon gold fries were absolutely perfect. The thick toast with a side of peach marmalade was delicious. I'm stoked they use locally grown produce, as that ensures that the food is always tip top. The super thick bacon that came with the waffles were just perfect balance of salt and savor. Simply bueno!\n\nI'm always in awe of the other reviewers who were expecting some Iron Chef to blow them away with spectacular gourmet food. To do the basic breakfast items and take them to another level should be spectacular in itself. I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast for simplistic elegance and for breakfast that truly did deserve Guy Fieri's adulation.\n\nHousekeeping items: Go Saturdays, so you can check out the Farmer's Market with all the free and tasty samples. That should keep you busy as your name floats to top of the wait list. The wait staff wants to turn over tables, so other Yelpers can get in and eat too. \n\nStay hungry my friends and happy eatings...",

I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny! \nThey had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room.\nI had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast.

Unfortunately, my seat was at a bar along a window that faced the hot Arizona sun.  I had to wear sunglasses while dining.\n\nI started with a cup of coffee.  It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful.  Anyway, that's not really where I'm hung up on this place.  What do you expect for a buck thirty-five?  No, my issue was with my food.\n\nHere's what I ordered: a Salami Scramble (basically scrambled eggs with salami) and a side of bacon.  The Salami Scramble was served with hash browns and toast.  The biggest disappointment of the meal was easily the Salami Scramble.  Having read good things about the entree, and upon recommendation of my server, I was excited to try the scramble.  Unfortunately, the scramble failed to live up to the hype. While the eggs were cooked perfectly (not too rubbery and not too runny), the overall flavor was off-putting.  The salami tasted okay, but in conjunction with the eggs, and the overpowering use of herbs, the final product was less than delicious.  Even after slathering the whole thing in catsup and hot sauce, the herbal and earthy overtones were overpowering.  I had the same problem with the hash browns: they were entirely overpowered with herbs.  I found myself actively trying to pick out the rosemary permeating the potatoes.\n\nAs far as the bacon goes, it was undercooked.  I like my bacon relatively crispy, perhaps more than others, but still, this was very chew.  The toast was fine.\n\nBecause of how much positive buzz this place has I may try it again - perhaps I was the victim of a rare poorly prepared meal here.

I can't say I am a huge fan of the potatoes as both the home fries and hashbrowns tend to be really greasy. That's okay, though, because the rest of the food is great. They also have thick-cut bacon you can order on the side that is pretty wonderful. I have eaten in the restaurant, sometimes, and I never had to wait too long and usually the wait seems to go by fast. Inside, the service is pretty efficient which at times can seem like they are pushing you out. But everyone is really friendly. I love that the farmer's market is right across the street which is great if you want to get out and have a nice breakfast before hitting the market. Matt's is closed on Mondays, FYI. Don't be like me trying to hit it up on a Monday off and throwing the collossal temper-tamptrum in the parking lot.",

I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.\n\nI decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!!

The Shire has many wonderful things to offer so we don't venture to far. \n\nThere's been talk of a movement in the great land of Gondor.. this movement is called Slow Food. Were great humans feed others based on sustainable crops, dairy and meat. These humans try to whenever possible, use only locally grown ingredients. There was word of an outdoor market that believes in these philosophies and shares with all the locals there. So off to Gondor.  \n\nAfter an easy and painless journey we arrived at the great outdoor market to find that it wasn't open yet. A very small distance east of there were a few humans mulling around a classic Gondor building that looked to have been turned into some sort of eatery. Once inside we discovered a great man named Matt and his magical Big Breakfast! We were seated at a counter with many other hungry travelers. \n\nA fair maiden appeared.. she was so friendly and welcoming.. then took our orders.. the great man Matt had created something just for that day.. Salsa Verde Huevos Rancheros. The way the maiden pronounced these words we though for a moment she was speaking Elven.. only moments had passed and then set before us were 2 huge plates filled with roasted potatoes, 2 eggs over easy atop a corn tortilla covered in a green sauce. You see hobbits love good food, you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs.. this was indeed a bountiful feast!  The fragrance arose from the plate and filled our nostrils.. we both stared into each others eyes then quickly began eating.. the flavors and textures were simply heavenly.. each better then the last! \n\nWe could see ourselves making the journey to Gondor quite often from the Shire.. we could see someday perhaps living in Gondor close to the outdoor market and of course the great Matt's Big Breakfast.",

I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH. \n\nFood. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato's were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast. \nI am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like \"the breakfast club\".",

The potatoes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but both the toast and the potatoes paled in comparison to the eggs.\n\nYes.  Eggs.  Matt's Big Breakfast earns my nod as the best breakfast joint I've ever patronized because of their eggs.  They were scrambled, but something about them was so mouthwatering that I was disappointed when I finished them.   Most scrambled eggs at other restaurants are served cold, dry, chewy, or any number of other unappetizing ways.  Not at Matt's.  I'm sure they cooked them in butter or something equally as awful for you but, damn, were they ever good.  To this day, nearly a year later, I still have not had better eggs anywhere else.

The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.

The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.

OH YEAH!!  and they offer fresh squeezed OJ.  that was one of my favorite parts.  When we were all said and done, we left with a $30 bill including tip.",

This was my first experience with Matt's; my classmate is a little more cultured that I am, so he knew the ropes from previous experiences. \n\nThere really isn't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant, but I used my university parking pass to park in the ASU lot right across the street. Even though we went on a Tuesday morning the place was still packed. But the 20 minute wait wasn't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area. \n\nOnce we were seated (in pretty close quarters I might add) our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. I got the honey lemonade which was such a great (and different) combination. \n\nMy classmate and I ordered the same breakfast entree: the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes. Sweet Mary, the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well. \n\nI will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled!",

I don't think I would try to go here during peak hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning, unless you like waiting a while to get seated. \n\nWe ordered the Salami Scramble (good) and the Waffle (great), along with a side of bacon. Their bacon is definitely one of the best in all of Phoenix, that's for sure. It's flavorful and juicy and crisp all at the same time. \n\nI don't think I would change a thing about this place, except for the sketchy location that it is in. It's kind of artsy fartsy and trendy on the one hand, but then on the other hand there are about 5 crack dens surrounding it. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be there alone at night.....hence why it is a breakfast place I guess. We actually experienced some of the shadiness first hand when we went to the hotel next door to go pee after our meal (no bathroom in the place). There was a torn up hooker in her 50's arguing with the lady at the check in desk about money with some guy who was missing all of his front teeth. There was obviously something illegal about to do down in one of the rooms, so we peed as quickly and quietly as we could and left the scene before we could get shot.

My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned.

If we weren't so far out of Scottsdale, I'm not sure my girlfriend and I would have withstood the wait. Boy were we happy with our decision to stay. The wait lasted about 45 minutes and we were in and out of the restaurant in about a half hour. I ordered the Five Spot sandwich and my beautiful girlfriend ordered the pork chop meal. We both had water with our meals and the total cost was $19.06. The wait staff is fairly attentive, nice, and very efficient. Unfortunately, we buffered the wait with coffee drinks from Royal at the Market coffee, located just down the street, and they told us at Matt's that outside drinks are not allowed which kinda sucked being that we just waited for 45 minutes in the hot sun. At this point, our expectations were very high and we were a little irritated by the wait, therefore the food had to deliver BIG...and it pretty much did. My sandwich was on a great brioche bun that was loaded with cheese, sunny side up egg, and two great slices of bacon. I also ordered a side of homefries which were perfectly seasoned with herbs and grilled onions. We both agreed the homefries rocked. My grilfriends pork chop was fried and came with this interesting light basil pesto shmear that was perfect. Her eggs were scrambled and the hash brown potatoes were more like a potatoe pancake and she liked it. Her dish also came with local sourdough toast and a great mixed berry jam. Nothing in this meal was cooked bad or served cold. We will probably return again as long as the temperature outside permits. One last FYI: Beware showing up in large groups.",

The juice is understandably \"freshly squeezed\" but a glass the size of a shot glass for almost 3 bucks is ridiculous. Personally I'm not one to enjoy water with a meal, which is probably your best choice so you don't end up spending your life savings on shots of OJ. They do have sodas but in a can and that's if you are an RC fan. The funny thing is I tried once to bring in a drink to help with the aid in digestion of my breakfast and they have a sign on the front door that reads \"No outside beverage\". Damn!",

I had been getting take out menus left on my door for months, so I decided to give it a shot.  They have a very large delivery area.  When I called, as soon as I told them it would be for delivery, they warned me that it may be an hour or so before it got to me.  That actually fit in well to my plans so I still went for it.  I ordered Mongolian Beef, Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Everything was absolutely dee-lish!  He even threw in 2 eggrolls!  They gave me plenty of sauces and fortune cookies (sometimes they're a little skimpy on these).  The portions were overflowing from the containers.  Plenty of food for the price.  And... the delivery came in only 45 minutes. The man making the delivery found my apartment with no problems and was very pleasant and very appreciative of my tip.

Maybe it was their way to keep the dish vegetarian, but not what I expected. The almond chicken was also just ok. There were a bunch of diced vegetables with some pieces of chicken in a watery sauce that had almonds in it. The sauces with the meals were so watery that the takeout boxes became weak and flimsy by the time I drove home.

I got six of them for less than three dollars!\n\nI had the dinner combination #7 which included a choice of one entree and came with fried rice, one egg roll, sweet and sour chicken, and choice of soup. I had the egg drop soup. \n\nMy dinner came to me in a timely manner and was just what I ordered. I chose the spicy orange chicken for my entree. The orange chicken was just spicy enough, but not too hot to eat. It had a thin breading on it which I really liked. The sweet and sour chicken had a thicker breading which I wasn't too fond of, but tasted good anyway. Next time I'll just get the orange chicken dinner. The fried rice was a brown rice if I'm not mistaken and was kinda plain, without any vegetables or egg so I spiced it up with some soy. The egg roll was a little over done on the outside and full of flavor on the inside.\n\nThere are not very many Chinese restaurants to choose between in my area of the valley and most of them are too expensive and lack good flavor. I'll be going back Wong's Jr again many more times in the future for sure! Another favorite would be China Grill. ;)",

Last weekend, the boards finally came off the windows and a sign went up to unveil... a Chinese restaurant!  \n\nWhile the name reminds me of something that is decidedly not food, the food inside is pretty solid.  I went there for take out, ordered their version of General Tsos, and got enough food to fill me up for both lunch and dinner that day, and they even threw in a free eggroll! (Might just have been a grand opening special though.)  The chicken was quality (not always the case at Chinese restaurants) and the sauce was good, but not that hot. My only complaint was that they had the weak mustard for the eggroll - I like the stuff that clears out your sinuses.  Maybe if you eat there you get the good stuff.\n\nI wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but I'm happy they are so close to my house... finally a much better option than Panda!",

I LOVE chinese and love sweet and sour sauce. First off, it smelled like sweet and sour sauce mixed with puke. I'm not kidding. I wouldnt say that to be mean, it is LITERALLY what it smelled like. We liked the crab puffs...just didnt have anything GOOD to dip them in. We both ordered teriyaki combo plates, and pork fried rice as well. Rice was ok...not much flavor. Hub never even got to his teriyaki last night....bad thing is, I did. I had probably about 5 bites before I put it in the fridge for tomorrow. It was the only thing I ate that hub didnt. I was up ALL NIGHT long in the bathroom. Sick as a dog. The teriyaki meals are still in my fridge and I plan to call about it.  ( JUST CALLED THE PLACE) spoke with the manager. I asked for a refund on just my two meals that wouldve totalled less that $15.  My order including tip- I even tipped 8 dollars!- was $38.   I've lived in peoria all 28 years of my life, and order from this place quite frequently. I have never asked for a refund or complained before. Usually they are our GO TO for chinese take out.  Guy said no, beccause people can eat, get full,and then call for refund.    ONe of my meals had like 5 bites taken out of it (that's what got me sick) and hub didnt even touch his yet, he put it in the fridge and was saving it for today......SO I OFFERED to take the food back to them.  He said no again. I asked for higher up and than him and he said there was no higher....just the owner. I asked for the owner's info or to give him my info for contact and he refused!  He said the owner would think it was silly and would laugh at him for not being able to handle it.   I said, ok, then why isnt this handled?   He again refused to take my info and then hung up on me.   I told him I write reviews and would post to the BBB- I wanted to speak with the owner. Im not some cheapy trying to get my money back.  I have a house, two vehicles, and a small business. $15 isnt anything but principal at this point. Your food made someone sick.  I didnt ask for a full refund and I tipped MORE than what is adequate.  I WAS a good customer and now they have lost our business.            Today is mother's day. Last night we ordered take out cause my inlaws just took the kids for the night. It was my relax night....and I ended up in the bathroom all night long- and feeling like crap this morning.

This restaurant just struck me as cheap. Simple as that. The price itself wasn't too bad; I paid $10 total. But it felt like Wong's Jr. cut every corner imaginable. It was one of the most lackluster Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.\n\nI had Szechuan Vegetables (\"extra spicy\") and Hot and Sour Soup. The Szechuan Vegetables were loaded with \"cheap\" vegetables - water chestnuts, carrots, onions, celery and green peppers. I don't have any problem with any of these vegetables in particular, but it's very telling that they are all \"cheaper\" vegetables. It felt like an insult. Like the restaurant was saying \"Oh, you want vegetables? Sure, let's give you the cheapest vegetables possible!\" \n\nWhere was the broccoli or the green beans? Wong's Jr. was too cheap to include them. The sauce was watery and weak. I was hoping for a thicker and more satisfying sauce. Don't get me wrong; it's not like it tasted bad or anything. But it was very unexciting and not worth buying.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hot and Sour Soup was plain and bare bones. Also very unexciting. The White Rice was below average and a poor complement to the main dish. My meal was served to me in a box that was cut in half. Way to cut corners by not having to buy plastic bags!\n\nI could go on about the depressing atmosphere and bash the restaurant some more, but I really don't need to. Wong's Jr. was just very lackluster. The food itself wasn't bad, but quite noticeably below average. Below average simply doesn't cut it in 2016. It might have worked in the past, but with all the amazing food options available today, a restaurant must go above and beyond. This is a disappointment.\n\nFor its below average service and food, Wong's Jr. gets 2 stars. It's certainly not the worst restaurant I have ever been to, but I have been to so much better. Wong's Jr. is not worth your time. Avoid.",

Call me a sucker for free egg rolls, but that was the coupon the hooked me in to ordering. Three years later I am still hooked on the food. \n\nThe sweet and sour pork/chicken is cooked to a crispy golden brown perfection. When you order them to go (delivery or pick-up) they pack them in the container minus the sauce. The only complaint that I have is that I wish that they would pack more of the veggie mix (carrots, onions, etc.) inside of the container. I believe that the sauce is made fresh because there have a few times were the sauce was either a little more sweet or sour than the previous experience. \n\nThe egg rolls are made fresh and again, they can vary from visit to visit in flavor, but they are always yummy. The Egg Flower soup is the perfect pick me up on a cold day, when you're feeling down, or just because you want something light and filling.

It took a long time and a lot of heartbreak, but Yelp finally led us to wonderful Wong's Jr - truly, it was love at first taste. The service here is always super friendly, professional, and fast. Their dinner specials are fabulous -  they come with rice, an egg roll, a crab puff, and either sweet and sour chicken or what they call BBQ chicken (it's no bbq I recognize, but it's definitely delicious!). The ton of food they give you is always piping hot, and the quality never varies. Sometimes they'll even throw in free egg rolls, if you order a lot.  I have a hard time straying from the lo mein, and Andy F adores the sesame chicken, but everything else we tried was just as good.

The noodles are always perfectly cooked and the flavors are great.  The vegetables always seem fresh and taste good.  \nGeneral Tso's is a good flavor.  The chicken is lightly breaded and cooked well.  The only thing I would add is a little spice.  It's very mild.  \n\nIt's not the best chinese but it's the best I've found in this area.

I would figure that their prices should be way more considering the AMOUNT of food you get.  We always have leftovers (and everyone knows leftover chinese is even better the next day.)  I'm also a very picky eater and they've never given me grief when I've asked for substitutions, nor have they ever messed up an order.  Plus, they'll give you complimentary egg rolls!\n\nAs far as the restaurant itself goes?  It's ghetto looking on the outside!  Last time we drove by there was graffiti on it I believe.  They're slowly but surely making it look more maintained (working neon signs, signs in their windows, etc.) but, whew.  Don't let that hold you back.  You step inside and it's got a flat screen TV usually with some sports event on.  Many tables/booths.  They also sell home made jewlery in the restaurant which is different.

I noticed right away that they had some creative additions to their menu: Creamy butter chicken, cheesy beef poutine, savory Asian BBQ, Smokey Maple Bacon & Grilled Chicken Club. I wanted to try all of them, but decided on just the butter chicken & poutine toppings. \n\nThe Butter Chicken pizza was AMAZING. They should put a patent on this flavour because it is the bomb. Generous pieces of chicken, roasted red peppers & mozzarella with the right amount of curry sauce on pan crust. DELICIOUS. \n\nThe Beef Poutine flavour was MEH. There wasn't enough cheese, and the few strands of fries on the pizza was crispy but lacked flavor. Overall, this pizza tasted too bland and dry. \n\nThe current deal is one of the above pizza for $15 and get the second medium pizza for $10.99! I had to pack the leftovers, which were still delicious the next day for those who enjoy cold pizza. \n\nOur server was also AMAZING. I can tell she could carry a conversation with anyone.

We watched as our server went to the front and asked the manager about this deal. After a short discussion she came back saying that we were restricted to only a few choices such as the Canadian pizza; basically just the few specialty pizzas with the least amount of toppings.

Both times I noticed that the utensils such as the forks were not properly cleaned and I'm not talking about water spots.\n\nThis place is a disgrace to Pizza Hut and I keep getting the impression that they are trying to cut corners everywhere.

Our server was nice but the hot water my family asked for was lukewarm (without lemon slices like some other places). I didn't get a straw with my cold water but I had to wait a good while till she came back with out pizza to ask her for one.

I have had enough eating home cooked meals.\n\nWhen we arrived a nice host guided us to our table.  It was dead quiet inside, only a few families were seated.  Angie was our server and we ordered our absolute favourite pizza, Large Pan Supreme Lover's with Extra Tomato Sauce.  She brought it to us within 10 minutes.  It was piping hot and super fresh and looked tremendously delicious.  I can never have Pizza Hut take out as it ruins it's crispness while enclosed in the box!  \n\nThe pizza was truly amazing, however, I would have given this place 5 stars if the pizza had that extra tomato sauce as it honestly was a bit lacking.\n\nThe nice host relieved Angie of her duties and billed us out.

There's more of everything. \n\nLocation:\nIn first Markham place.\n\nParking:\nIf you come in prime time, around suppertime get someone else to drive or park farther away. \n\nDecor:\nSeating is tables or booths, its a smallish space but I go out to eat before 7 so there's seats and The sizzling plates come quick. Also I've made reservations. It helps with getting a seat. No wait \n\nThey took off all the previous decor, its plain inside\n\nFood:\nWhenever I've gone it's been in groups of 6 or more.  The first time there was 8.\nWe've tried,. The chicken cartilage, ( was weird but deep fried so good), popcorn chicken, 5 spice wings, meatballs with cheese ( yummy), oh the shrimp app - very good.\n\nI tried the supreme sizzling plate. That was the only thing I wasn't too keen on. Its kinda plain compared to what it used to be. It used to be nice and peppery. Not anymore. Can't recommend it. The beef tongue sizzling plate was good as well as the scallop and noodles.\n\nThere's some cool desserts. If you like durian there's a bunch. Someone ordered durian balls. I didn't try it but there was no durian smell so no worries the place doesn't smell like death. Haha I tried the parfait twice. I love it. It's like cereal and granola with ice cream and whipped cream yum. Ooh and the smore waffle. That was just ok the waffle is not the fluffy sweet ones that I like . It does come with ice cream as well. I prefer the parfait. \n\nStaff:\nService is great if it's not busy. When it's busy it can be slow. But when you come as a large group it gives you time to catch up and take your time eating apps. \n\nConclusion:\nI've been a few times and we've never had anything wrong.

Sauce was meh and for whatever reason, it was spicy.  I don't remember it saying it was spicy on the menu.  I mostly just shrugged it off because there was a small amount of sauce and it wasn't drenched.  Popcorn Chicken Rice.  The popcorn chicken was fantastic.  Cooked perfectly, tasty and juicy.  The problem was my rice.  I don't like most sauces so I asked for just soy sauce on it.  But it was the same stuff that was on the rice noodle roll.  There was a lot of it on this.  This made the rice completely inedible for me.  So I essentially ended up paying $10 for the popcorn chicken.  I also ordered the Miso soup but apparently they ran out of that.\n\nAdd to the fact that they only had two staff members taking care of the entire place, it's just not enough.  I don't think our waiter checked up on us once after he took our order and I constantly had to find him to ask for water (to counter the spicy food).\n\nSo that was a disappointing dinner experience for me.  I don't think I'll be returning anymore if I can help it.  The food is super pricey and it's very hit or miss.",

It was still not full around 7pm, though. The decor is minimalistic but classy, with pictures of menu items on the walls.\n\nI ordered the Supreme Beef Rice for $9.99 based on my friend's recommendation. Our food came fairly quickly. You must mix the rice and beef in order to cook the beef, and the hot plate was just hot enough that it cooked my beef (although some parts remained a bit pink). Other reviews have stated that the plate remains hot for too long, but I didn't find that a problem. The food was quite tasty, although it wasn't as flavourful as I expected. The beef was a bit plain, as it was mostly the rice that was saucy. It has a strong peppery taste, and I just wish it was a bit more saucy for the beef. The portion size was quite big for the price, and it filled me up easily.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the meal and would come back to try their poutine or desserts!

AKA Teppan closed and re-opened with a new expanded menu and rebranded as Flaming Kitchen.  This place is a copy of Pepper Lunch.\n\nFor those who haven't tried this before, meals are served on a HOT plate (200+ degress Celsius) - so DO NOT TOUCH!  They have a lot of menu items in their new menu, however I always go the Supreme Beef - it is too good to resist! Supreme Beef is their specialty and you won't get a screwed up order.  Basically, what you get is a bowl of rice with butter and special sauce goodness in the middle.  The rice is surrounded by rolls of beef (think of those rolls of beef that you get for Chinese hot pot).  It is up to you to unroll the beef, along with breaking up the rice and mixing the butter and sauce.  As you mix, the beef is cooked and the flavours are all mixed in.\n\nWe did also order the Seafood Pancake, Black Sesame Parfait and Mango Supreme.  Seafood Pancake is all dough, with maybe 2-3 pieces of squid - DO NOT order this!  Black Sesame Parfait is decent as well as the Mango Supreme.  I wouldn't come here just for the dessert, however their dessert is decent, actually better than other dessert only places in First Markham.\n\nNote 1: I don't think their \"plate oven\" is very large.  If you have multiple party members, it is unlikely that you get your meal at the same time.  The orders will roll out as the plates are done, so you should start cooking your food once you get your plate, don't wait for the others in your group to get their food.\n\nNote 2: I noticed a lot of reviews complained about the service - I agree, the waitresses here are a bit dense and don't seem to know much.

Although it tasted great on its own I have to say it did not pair particularly nicely with a spicy dish or curry.\n\nWe did not order any appetizers as our party of two decided to save room for dessert instead!\n\nWe ordered the flaming spicy chicken noodle which was spicy but I would consider it a hotter medium. It's not the kind of space that lingers but it does have a Nice kick to it. There are a few pieces of chicken that come with it on a sizzling plate served with splash guards. The cheese on the noodle made it a little less boring but it still seems like the dish with missing something. It did not seem like a particularly large dish but it could have been the grease or the cheese that made it quite filling.\n\nThe black curry pork cutlet udon soup had better assortment of ingredients. The cutlet was a good size and crispy although it was served in the soup. The curry reminds me a little of Manpuku Japanese curry udon. \n\nWe topped off our meal with the green tea lava cake with vanilla ice cream.

Then what the flying fuck was the other girl checking and telling us that it'd be ready in 2 minutes?????? \n\nWhen we were leaving, one of the servers stopped my bf not to say sorry but to say \"didn't you have a pop?\" and tried to charge him for the yelp check in deal.\n\nI AM SO DONE. \nDo not, I repeat, DO NOT support a place that is like this. If you're a long term follower of my reviews, you know I keep it 100% real all the time. So who will you believe? Your favourite foodies that sell themselves out for a free teppan dish? (again, I'm not personally hating on anyone specifically but IF THE SHOE FITS.) Or moi, who works @ yelp and still has no filter on delivering the truth.\n\nPs. if you are the owner and you see this, do not ask me to email you or offer to make it better for next time, I am not wasting my time and not interested in coming to flaming kitchen again, so don't waste yours.",

It was exactly the same as Aka Teppan's. The sizzling plates really keeps your food warm until the last bite. The sauce was tasty, but they loaded the rice with so much... probably to try to cover up the lack of flavour from the beef itself. It's pretty much what you would expect it to be though. \n\nWe got there early on a weekend evening, and had planned on getting dessert after. The food came out quickly but then the place got busy and they seemed to want us to leave after eating our main. They cleared our table and never bothered refilling our water. We decided to skip it and went somewhere else instead. \n\nThey only accept debit over $25, which is very high considering a meal is about $12 on average.

Was not impressed. \n\nArrived around 12:40pm on a Friday afternoon and this place was packed. Luckily, there was one booth table left. There is barely any room between the seat and the table (not movable). I'm quite petite and I found it very uncomfortable already. \n\nOrdered three sizzling plates: the chicken spicy noodles, salmon and shrimp rice, and black curry pork cutlet rice. Each were $11.99. Waited 45 minutes to 1 hour for the food to come. None of them met my expectations. \n\nChicken spicy noodles: \nI already stated that I wanted less spicy and wrote it on the paper used for ordering. It was even stated on my receipt. I'm not sure how spicy it is regularly, but with less spicy it was still super duper spicy. Also, there is supposed to be cheese in this dish, but I could barely taste it. This noodles is more like spicy instant noodles without soup with a few bits of chicken. My throat is still hurting from this dish. \n\nSalmon and shrimp rice: \nThis is the perfect representation of \"picture vs. reality food\". The picture in the menu looked like there are four big slices of salmon and four big shrimps (in Chinese it even translates into salmon and BIG shrimp rice). When it came, it was more like four teeny tiny pieces of salmon and four baby shrimps (see my picture). The salmon and shrimps were both extremely dry and salty even when eaten with the rice. In the middle of the rice there was a piece of butter which I wasn't aware of, so I almost puked when I ate it. \n\nBlack curry pork cutlet rice: \nMeh. The curry was a very thick sauce. Not spicy at all (I like curry with a hint of spiciness). The pork cutlet was very thin pieces of pork that were breaded heavily. They were also soggy as they were drenched in the sauce. There was also a piece of butter in the rice and this time I knew better. This dish was the only one I could actually eat. \n\nWanted to order some durian desserts after, but we didn't want to wait another hour for them.\n\nService: \nThe waitress was very weird. She would say everything in Cantonese first, then after we responded, she would repeat what she said in English as if we didn't understand. Sometimes she would be speaking Mandarin to us. Also, when she asked if we wanted more water, without waiting for us to respond, she already poured it into the cup. \n\nWhen I asked for the bill, I showed the waitress the Instagram post and told her about the 15% off and she kinda nodded. However, there was no discount on the receipt we received after. I called over the waiter and he looked at the Instagram post as if he never saw it before. Then he went back to reprint the receipt. This time, there was only 10% discount when the post clearly said 15%. I didn't have much patience left so I just paid and left. \n\nDefinitely will not be coming back as the food is not very good and also for that price, I can easily find much better tasting food. Also, I get that it is busy around lunch time, but why does it take an hour to make these dishes? The wait itself already left me with a terrible impression. With the food and service on top, I would only give 1 star.",

Currently in their soft opening phase, replacing Aka Teppan with essentially the same menu along with some additional items introduced. \n\nSpicy Mentaiko Beef Udon ($12.99) - The udon texture was done perfectly with the right amount of cheesy sauce and a bit of spice. However for the price, there was not much meat and the meat quality itself was lacking in my opinion. If you are a meat eater like myself, this may not fully satisfy you. But definitely give it a try if you love melted cheese and chewy udon.\n\nTom Yum Shrimp ($7.99) - These shrimps were lightly crisp and were really plump in texture. The tom yum sauce was flavourful but there was just too much of it. Although the shrimp still remained crispy for the most part, it would have been much better if they had the sauce on the side.",

Hot metal plates that are heated to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. raw meat with vegetables and/or rice are then placed on the plates, where they cook in front of the customer. The meat can be eaten rare or well done, depending on the customer's preference.\n\nThe restaurant is located in the same location as Aka Teppan before and they have had a complete rebranding. The menu was revemped with lots more dessert additions, with over 15 pages of food ranging from snacks, hot plates, dessert, and bubble tea drinks. \n\nAppetizers\nWe tried a variety of appetizers which are mostly fried. Flaming Kitchen is quite generous with the portion of their appetitizer so it is best to be shared among a few persons\n\nCurry Fries is made with Japanese curry served on a hotplate. We love Japanese curry and their sweet and spicy flavor, and it goes perfectly well with the fries.\n\nTom Yum Shrimp  were lightly crisp and were really plump in texture. The tom yum sauce was flavourful but and gives a spicy kick.\n\nThese two are must try for all cheese fans: Bite Sized Cheese and Cheese Rice Cake. Both are made with a lot of cheese and the melted cheese on the sizzling hot plate just taste so good\n\nMain\nSpicy Mentaiko Beef Udon is an interesting twist on Japanese udon. The udon texture was done perfectly with the right amount of cheesy sauce and a bit of spice from the mentaiko. It is also very satisfying to see the beef cooked on the hot plate right in front of you.\n\nJumbo Scallop Spaghetti with Truffle Cream Sauce has a very rich sauce and also very strong truffle flavor. The scallop is really jumbo in size and blend in well with the spaghetti.\n\nIn the revemped menu there are also lots of desserts and drinks. We tasted the Panna Cotta and Sizzling Marshmallow Waffle. The waffle was very cute since it is served on a small metal pan and definitely very Instagrammable.\n\nOverall we enjoyed Flaming Kitchen and would come back for more sizzling hot plates.",

My filling fell out and I just needed a quick trip to the dentist. I searched on yelp for a few great reviews and his office was the third closest to my apartment. The other two dentists didn't make much of an attempt to help since they were full.  His staff understood that my only day off was Friday and squeezed me into his full schedule when I voiced my concern about my tooth cracking. He made the experience painless and his entire staff was amazing! If you are looking for the office, it is on the West side of Jeffrey Street; either Google maps or yelp showed the office on the east side and that is incorrect.  Also, I don't currently have dental insurance and I was pleasantly surprised to know that they give a cash only discount.  I've only been in Vegas for around a year and I'm happy to say that I feel very comfortable with this dentist and his staff.  5+ Star Service!",

We asked one of the staff members if he could assist and despite the fact the store was slammed with customers, he patiently walked me over to the location of the specific plants I sought.  The plants were in great condition, with stocky stems and healthy roots.  Pricing was more than the big box stores, but in line with other local nurseries like Bruce Co and Jung's. \n\nThe nursery is a lot larger than it looks.  I admit I have driven by this place dozens of times and had no idea they stock a broad inventory of shrubs and trees.  Their perennial selection is limited, but I am spoiled by the extensive inventory found at the Flower Factory in Stoughton.\n\nThere is no parking lot for the nursery, but there is plenty of street parking on Gateway Place.\n\nBased on my favorable first impression, I definitely will be frequenting Fair Oaks Nursery over the course of the growing season.

The younger generations need to know where us as Americans came from and what we overcame together as a whole to respect all Vets from all branches and eras because all had a hand in shaping this wonderful free country we take for granted and to know that even tho were free, its those who honorably and proudly put on that uniform day in and day out who pay for our freedom with their sacrifices and that is why im proud to be a citizen of this great nation. Veterans and their families go thru so much during times of conflict and those who can relate know all too well the sacrifice and faith, if you may, that goes with the obligation of duty and honor. This beautiful, serene park is an outstanding example of an expression of gratitude to all those past & present who've paid the ultimate sacrifice and is a must see to truly a experience what I attempted to describe here :)",

We've read many positive reviews about Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza and thought  it was time to go and see for ourselves . Hard to believe,  after all these years of Iiving in Arizona I had never visited Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, until recently. \n\nIf you haven't had an opportunity to explore the memorial you need to plan a visit.  The memorial is a amazing tribute  to Arizona service personnel who've lost their lives fighting for our country in various wars.\n\nThe plaza is surrounded by grass and is very clean.  The park is a great place to stop, get out, relax, and learn a few things.  The exhibit is all outdoors and streches  about one city block, making it is an easy level walk for just about anyone and the exhibit is free.\n\nAmong the histotic monuments is the U.S.S. Arizona anchor and mast, and various mouments such as the Navajo Code Talkers of Word War II, an educational monument to the Bill of Rights, Vietnam War memorial, 9-11 memorial, a Law Enforcement Canine Memorial, and many more historical figures.\n\nThe old state capitol is across the street, with it's copper dome. How much time youll spend at Wesley Bolin Memorial is up to you,  it will depend on how much you wish to see.",

What I really appreciated was that they did not have any loud and obnoxious screaming matches in Vietnamese like many other places. They made certain that my nails were completely dry prior to leaving. Before the gratuity, I paid $25 cash for the pedicure.\n\nI should also mention that they offer a loyalty program. After seven visits when you spend $25 or more, you can redeem for one of the following three services: manicure; eyebrow shaping or tinting; or 15-minute hand or foot massage.\n\nI definitely plan to return and will update accordingly.

I was lucky to get a table during the lunch time rush with a group of 5 coworkers, considering we didn't make a reservation. The service is quite efficient here, probably because they are accustomed to dealing with Financial District employees who are pressed for time. They have a fairly large variety of options on their lunch menu - individual sushi rolls, salads, bento boxes, and they have a mix of Japanese and Korean food (i.e. bibimbap, etc.) For a nicer sit-down restaurant, the prices are pretty reasonable, mostly ranging from $10-$15 for a lunch item. One of my coworkers ordered a bento box/set lunch, and it came with a LOT of food - sushi rolls, teriyaki chicken, glass noodles, tempura, etc. My other coworkers ordered salads (not just your typical salads, one was a calamari salad and I forget what the others were), and they were presented very nicely and looked delicious. I got chirashi don for $15.99 and was pleased and satisfied with my choice. It came in a decent sized portion with lots of sashimi on it.

Luckily, it wasn't terribly busy and we were seated right away.\n\nOur server was friendly and efficient, though there was a bit of a \"situation\" near the end, but more on that later.\n\nWe ordered endamame, California rolls and a grilled scallop with mango salad.  All three dishes were delicious, though the portion size for the California roll was a bit small.  The scallops (2 large scallops) were perfectly grilled and the mango salad, which wasn't really a mango salad, but rather a few slivers of mango and cucumber thrown onto a small bed of mixed greens, was perfectly dressed with just a drizzle of a sweet citrus dressing.\n\nOur total bill for the 2 appetizers and California roll was $33 including tip.\n\nOf note, we were in a bit of a hurry to pay our bill as my colleague had a 1pm meeting, so we handed our server a credit card and asked her to process our bill.  She came back to our area with a large platter of food for the table behind us, along with our bill. However, after having served the table their food, our server opened up the billfold to check before handing us our bill, only to discover that the credit card was gone...after a few frantic minutes of servers racing around the restaurant looking under tables and plates to try and locate the missing credit card, the table behind us announced to our server that they had located the credit card under their table.  It must have fallen out of the billfold while she was dropping off their food.\n\nAnyway, crisis averted.  All in all a good experience.  Food was ok, price was a little on the high side, but it is lunch downtown.\n\n**I would like to note that I do order take-out from them quite often...best to call well in advance of pick up, and make sure you check your order before leaving, as they've forgotten to include items on more than one occasion.",

I always order the salmon and tuna maki, and have never had a bad piece of fish here. I like that they don't use too much rice in the rolls (not a fan of huge rolls that you can barely fit in your mouth), and that they have options for non-sushi eaters. I also highly recommend the gyoza- delicious!\n\nI (along with the rest of my office) often get take-out from Akco for lunch.  We've never had a bad experience, and it's usually a very quick turn-around. \n\nMy only warning is that it seems like the quality is better at lunch than dinner. I recently went for happy hour (30% off between 3-7pm) for the first time, and can understand why other reviewers may have been disappointed if that was their only experience with Akco. I'm not sure what it was, but some of the rolls were not in keeping with the quality that i've come to expect from them. For example, the fish was a bit too cold and the rice tasted like it had been in the fridge.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. \n\nOverall, it's one of the better options in the financial district for sushi and I'll definitely be back.",

This seems to be the only place in the downtown core where you can find it (or at least so I could find).\n\nIt's a pretty solid choice for when food court sushi won't cut it, but you don't want to spend the $$$$ to go to a place like Ki.",

It was really tasty, full of flavour. The batter was light and fluffy and didn't give me that gross feeling when I eat KFC. They also fry different parts of the chicken, breasts, thighs, wings and cut them up into small pieces so it's easy to eat. \n\nHowever, if you don't eat spicy food there are not that many choices on the menu. I did try their egg roll and corn cheese. The egg roll is exactly what the name says it is, it's like scrambled eggs pan fried to a flat sheet and rolled up. There might have been something inside maybe a bit of meat? But not noticeable. They put this ketchup-like sauce on top, which gives it a tomato flavour. This dish was a bit plain to me, not that exciting. The corn cheese was a bit weird to me. It was tasty but it is basically some frozen corn on a hot plate with some cheese. \n\nThis place is also notorious for the bad service! I have been here once before and waited a long time and was not seated. The waitress don't really pay attention to the people when they are trying to get her attention. Simple stuff like if customers sat for a long time you should go over and see if they are ready to order, you should ask if they want something to drink, you should know your menu well enough to explain each item, also after people ask for the bill you should go back to get them change or process credit card payments etc. They obviously had zero training to be in the food service industry.

I'm not sure if Korean fried chicken is normally sweet (the spicy garlic and cheese wings, as well as the spicy sauce wings were both sweet, much to our surprise and disgust), but I was not anticipating the butter and garlic fries to be sweet as well (honey-flavored?), which turned off my appetite completely. In fairness, everyone has different food preferences and taste buds, so let me get to the real reason my experience was rock bottom. \n\nUpon entering, we waited around hoping someone would eventually appear to seat us. We waited five minutes before even seeing a waitress, who we had to flag down to be seated.\n\nShe drops some menus off at our table shortly after we sit, and abandons us within seconds. Classy.\n\nA few minutes later she pops by, asking if we're ready, to which we replied yes. The waitress turns and starts walking away; I yell, \"excuse me, we're ready\". She walks back over and stares at us. We proceed to order awkwardly.\n\nThe butter garlic fries came first. We inquire why it was sweet - the waitress replies without sympathy, \"this is not what you wanted?\" And we say, \"no, we thought it would be salty\". She shrugs and mutters \"sorry\", then turns and walks away. Doesn't offer any alternatives or suggestions.\n\nAfter eating, we make three attempts to flag this waiter down to pay our bills. My first friend makes eye contact with the waitress and says, \"excuse me\". My friend is ignored.\n\nMy second friend flags her down while the waitress walks by, who proceeds to a different table before returning to ours (without acknowledgement). This tells me the waitress clearly heard and saw my friend, but ignored him to attend to the other table first.\n\nAfter requesting our bills, the waitress disappears, and returns with boxes for our food. No bills. As she turns away hastily, I frustratingly yell out, \"EXCUSE ME! .. Can we please have our bills?\" She comes back over and says she'll bring them, but we have to pay up front.\n\nAt this point I was thoroughly displeased with the food and service as a whole and just want to leave. I'm sad to admit that I'm a very generous but simultaneously vindictive tipper - I easily and frequently will tip up to 20% on a meal if the service is even modestly appeasing, however if my experience is as unpleasant as the one I had at The Fry on Yonge and Sheppard, I will tip nothing. When the girl who rung up my bill saw I had not tipped, she muttered \"service charge is not included\". Not hearing fully (her voice drowned out by the blaring music) I asked her to repeat herself. \"Service charge is not included in your total\" she remarks flatly, looking at me with expectation. I stare her in the eye and respond equally as unimpressed, \"I know\", waiting for her to ask why I chose not to tip, and ready to provide feedback. She stares at me, then rips my receipt off the machine and tosses it aside and proceeds to cash out my friend. She clearly did not give a damn about her customers, much like the waitress who served us. \n\nI'm extremely glad I did not tip and will not be returning to this establishment.

Nonstop! \n\nOpen only for dinner starting at 5pm, the busiest hours are when people are ready for beers: ~7-10pm.  Korean fried chicken is made for beer and soju - something I've learned from reading their reasonably priced soju/beer + fried chicken combo menus that cost roughly $28.  Oh, and also from Korean dramas, cause those are real-life, obviously!\n\nPicking just a basket of fried chicken, regardless of small or large, will have you starting your meal with a sizzling foil-lined cast iron skillet of corn.  I'm pretty sure it came out of a can, but whatever, the sizzly factor makes it tastier.  What is this stuff called anyway?  Loose corn?  Corn bits?  (I think what I mean is kernels). \n\nBatter is mixed with corn starch so it's a lighter and fluffier batter than the American style of fried chicken.  Whole, dark pieces of meat contain the bones still in, and those to me are the tastiest parts.  Sometimes not a whole lot of meat on those ones, but who cares?  The most important part is dat chicken skin! Oh, yes!  That crispy exterior is like breaking the burnt sugar layer of a creme brulee.  \n\nThe meat is moist, flavourful from keeping the bones in. I like to ask for a spicy sauce and a regular sauce on the side, so maintain the height of crispy chicken but still able to dip in the meat.  Ordering extra sauce on the side means you get less sauce in the small container plus an additional $1 per container, but I think it's a worthwhile cost to prevent soggy fried chicken.  Sogginess is fried chicken suicide!  \n\nGreen onion chicken has a minimal amount of sauce on top, but is covered with a heaping mound of shredded green onions.  I've been told that this is a popular way to eat fried chicken in Korea.  Why? I dunno, but I shovelled in mouthfuls of green onion after each chicken bite anyway.\n\nGarlic soy sauce is my hubs' least favourite.  He says it just tastes like sweet soy sauce and it makes the chicken soggy. \n\nThe spicy sauce is truly quite spicy, so have some drinks on handy.  Some beer or soju perhaps? \n\n!!!",

The Fry specializes in Korean-style fried chicken, which is basically a fried chicken dish prepared in a Korean style. \n\nAfter we ordered our food, our server brought us a plate of side dishes of green salad, white radish, and macaroni salad. We were also given a hot plate of seared corn. We ordered the special half & half chicken ($27.99) - fried chicken, and fried chicken in spicy sauce, as our main dish. I'd say that this dish was more than enough for two people, as we left with a few leftover pieces. The fried chicken in spicy sauce was true to its name, as it was rather spicy and flavorful. Additionally, I liked that the chicken pieces were evenly coated in the sauce. \n\nThe second chicken dish that came with the combo was the fried chicken, which was a generous portion of pieces. Korean Fried Chicken is fried twice, and this results in the skin being crispier. The chicken skin was indeed crispy and perfectly spiced, and the meat was juicy on the inside. This way of deep drying also creates a lot less grease all over the chicken. Lastly, as a side, we got the crispy French fries ($6.99. I loved these lightly battered fries, as they were very crispy, and not oily at all. Overall, The Fry was a great introduction to Korean Fried Chicken for me, as I have never tried it before.

If you're hoping that this will taste something like All Stars or Wild Wings, you're looking in the wrong place. They server Korean style chicken wings, which are a bit more saucy. The chicken is crispy, but it is not oily. If you really like Korean food, the sauces they use will be to your liking; else, I don't think you'll enjoy it that much either.\n\nWhen I went, we also got the garlic butter fries.

I ONLY recommend this dish and the butter garlic fries if you are going to be eating here. \n\nThe fry is a place to socialize over delicious fried foods and an assortment of Korean Street food for sharing.\n\nFirst, they welcome you with an assortment of cold side dishes. This includes their sweet cubed pickled radishes, green salad, and cole slaw. Some of the yummiest side dishes to accompany a nice bite of green onion chicken! (As a side note, ask them to refill it if you run out). \n\nEach table also gets their own sizzling hot buttered corn. While this dish isn't refillable, it's delicious Korean buttered corn which most places don't offer as a side. \n\nFinally, the food. Again, only order the boneless green onion fried chicken. We once had the misfortune of eating normal green onion fried chicken which was drier and not as juicy as the boneless version. \n\nAlso, if you're a sauce person, ask for some extra on the side. \n\nEach piece is lightly battered and juicy. It's meant to be eaten with the shredded green onions, so don't be afraid to take a bite of them together! \n\nAlso, if you like honey butter flavoured things, you won't be disappointed by the butter garlic fries which are a MUST every time we go.\n\nAll in all, in love with the green onion chicken here! \n\nService is a hit or miss sometimes depending on who's there though; hence, 4 stars",

I will recommend you to forget about the service.

I'm not the biggest coffee connoisseur but I very much enjoyed the latte. \n\nTheir food items are very tasty too - I tried the almond croissant/pastry (sooo good!) and also their chia seed pudding. I am not exaggerating, but the chia seed pudding is by far THE BEST I've ever had. It had a nice vanilla / almond / cardamom flavour with coconut shavings, fruit, and granola. Unlike other chia seed puddings, this one is very thick and not watery. For about $8-9 dollars, the pudding is definitely worth the price and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it. \n\nI'm a huge fan of this place and I've become a regular whenever I'm in the area!",

My family and I went to Game Seven Grill on the evening before Superbowl 49, at around 7:15pm.  While we waited for a table, I used the restroom.  It was a mess, lacking in toilet paper and with mounds of wet paper on the floor.  As I returned to the hostess podium, I saw another female patron tell the manager about the condition of the bathroom, so I did not.  At that point, we were seated, at approximately seven thirty.  As with Dwayne O.'s review, we were seated in the back area of the restaurant, in the new girl's section.  Our server, was quick to greet us and take our order.  We were seated ten feet from the bar, so we guessed that our order of three sodas would not take long....we were wrong.  At 7:49 we received our drinks, nearly twenty minutes after we had been waiting.  Two bartenders were just standing behind the bar, but seemed unconcerned that we were sitting ten feet away with no drinks, no silverware and no food.  We did also notice at least five bussers who walked around with bus tubs cleaning tables and removing plates from other patrons.  When our server brought our drinks, she explained it was her first day (!) and said that someone was supposed to help her out with dropping off the drinks, but they \"sent a lot of people home.\"  On a Saturday night.  At 7:30pm.  With the Superbowl in town and hundreds of thousands of people milling around outside...Yeah, sure.  As we waited for our food, we noted a couple who sat at one of the tables beside us and then move to the bar.  They received their food before we did, as did the other two tables around us.  At 8:10, a full twenty minutes after the drinks, we received our food.  Our server again apologized and said the \"kitchen had gotten backed up\" but that did not seem to slow the service to the others around us. The menu was very limited, so we ordered two cheeseburgers and my son ordered wings.  The burgers were okay; nothing special and I could not taste the pepper jack cheese on my burger.  My son, 12, eats anything...and I mean anything.  However, he could only eat four of his eight wings because they were a touch too tough and over-sauced.  He got 8 wings for $10.95 with no side...clearly a disappointment.  When we were finally finished, we spoke with the manager at the hostess station.  I explained our disappointment, he apologized several times and said there was nothing he could do for this experience, just the next one and I assured him there would be no \"next one\". As a former restaurant server and manager, I can honestly say that I will never again visit Game Seven Grill.",

Will not go back!\n\nFIrst off, there is little seating unless you have a RESERVATION!  Many available tables to the left of the entrance for reservations, but for folks without a reservation tables were to the right side.  Our choices were inside where there was a bar and about 15 tables (all full) , or outside where there were about 5 tables and some red picnic tables lined up.  \n\nThe picnic tables were so close together some were difficult to get between and were filthy!  Plus, the red seemed to rub off on clothes and shoes.\n\nNow we could deal with all that seeing as the place is right outside the stadium.  So we found a table and tried to order food.  We had to ask around to find how to do that- then be self-sufficient in the process!  We had to go to the hostess station for a menu, and then go inside to the bar to order and pay.  They did ask where we were sitting, brought it out when it was done and waiters appeared once the order was up to bring the food and condiments.  Food was just OK- \n\nThe real kicker for us was that the prices on the menu for food and beer were not what  we were charged.  Our hamburger was listed at 10.95 but we were charged 11.95- not a huge difference but still annoying.\n\nThe real difference came in the beer.  Beers listed on the menu as $5-$6 were actually $7-$8 when you got them!  Again not a big deal seeing as we were so close to the stadium, but still annoying.  Why print a menu price if it's not correct???\n\nIf the tables had been clean, the place more organized, and the menu pricing reflecting the actual prices- the whole experience would have been different for us.  \nThe place is convenient if you are meeting someone before a game, but I can honestly say we will not be returning!",

Since there was six of us we ordered two nachos, a pretzel bread, pork sliders, two brisket quesadillas, and a vegetable flatbread. The cheese sauce and chicken on the nachos were to die for. Wait everything I tasted was amazing I was truly being selfish with my meal. we paid for our meal and left to go to the game. I read other people's reviews and I have to say I didn't experience any bad vibe with this place.

Lets turn double play and discuss Game Seven:\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI must admit, I did not try food when I went. Reason being, it was pretty expensive, and I had already stretched the ol' budget for the tickets I got. I saw some people's items, and yes it does beat what you get in the stadium, but just by a little. Quality is that of a normal sports bar. I have seen much better. As for drinks, wow, so priced up. I get it, I do. They have to to make ends meet. But seriously, $6.50 for a pint? Plus, its just general across the board, so from Stella to Budweiser....its $6.50. It once again beats inside, but why bother? There is a place right down the corner that is about half this price.....hmm I wonder where...read on...\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nJust like the old Sliders here, nothing much has changed. Its a nice wide open space with two levels to choose from. The outdoor patio is inviting, even in hot weather there are misters and a good amount of room to bring a group of friends. There is not much ambiance to the place, the bar area itself is wide open with a couple TV's and long bar. Not an abundance of flare or items on walls. As for service, I can only attest to the barkeeps. They were very attentive, although I went very early to the game and was one of the few there...it wasn't hard to serve me. Each of the individuals I worked with were talkative and fun, and were prompt when I asked to close out.\n\n\nExtras/Rating~\nTwo stars are provided for location to ballpark and friendly service. I truly feel that this is place is a trap for out-of-towners. They  come to see their team and did not check it out in advance or ask the motel/hotel where to go pre-game. I went for the Orioles series, and at the first game, there was a sea of orange here. The next game, they all realized to go to another location...I did as well. For better deals, including HAPPY HOUR PRICES, go to Coach's Corner, just a stone's throw away on Jefferson. Prices for food and drinks are much cheaper, along with comparable service. I rarely shout out another business on a review, but seriously, do not waste your money for beer, it makes no sense. I see redeeming factors if you have a super large group of friends wanting a quick beer or two before/after the game. Besides that, skip Game Seven Grill and choose from a ton of other bars in the area.",

I ordered a $6 Bud Light, in the aluminum bottle. The server advised me that they were all out of Bud Light in the bottles. That was at 5:40 pm - an hour-and-a-half before the game. Really? If I am going to get fleeced for a $6 bottle of beer, the least they can do is have it in stock! I opted for the $7 Bud Light draft and soon regretted that I had dropped any money at this place. \n\nI am done with this place.

I asked if the Schreiner's sausage was served whole, like a hot dog, or shaved on a hamburger bun. \"I'm not sure, sorry.\" Okay.... We also asked if they had XX Lager or amber, and she said amber. I thought it was weird because the lager is so common, but dismissed it...until I saw someone walk away from the bar with a lager.

It was...awkward. Especially because the restaurant wasn't even busy! In keeping with the theme, our server came and dropped the check, picked it up, and brought it back without ever speaking a word to us. \n\nSo, anyway, I got nachos ($12?!). The chicken that came on them was like rubber, and in huge long pieces that needed to be cut to fit into a bite. Nachos are not a fork and knife friendly food. The cheese sauce was gross and the chips were hard, and the sour cream was a laughable little squeeze. My husband got the 3 pulled pork sliders ($10), which came without sauce which is weird, and on dry bland buns. The fries were okay. We left well over half our food untouched.

The premises were clean, everything was in great shape.  The bed was comfy and the room was quiet.  Wireless internet worked seamlessly in my room and had a strong signal.  The staff at the front desk were friendly, and the breakfast was tasty.\n\nThis motel is conveniently located near I-90/OH-2 and the Ohio Turnpike, I-80.  Although it is in a nebulous suburban wasteland between the two dumps of Elyria and Lorian, there are a few places to eat around it, if you know the area.  Not my favorite part of Ohio, but if you're staying here, this is a perfectly fine place to say and I would gladly recommend it.",

This is where they lost 2 stars. I'm not going to lie...I may have booked this hotel because it offered a breakfast in the morning. I knew I was going to spend a lot of money on this trip and quick and convenient free breakfast in the morning was a really nice perk.\nThere were absolutely no menu options but 3 cereals, mushy instant eggs, and sausage gravy.

The young gal at the counter was assisting a customer with a very large loose tea purchase of six bags at a cost of $80. She never even looked up and greeted us as we waited.  we finally interrupted and asked how does it work here?  she said oh you just pick out what you want and I'll start it for you. Never once did she say there is freshly brewed tea by the glass, self service around the corner. We only found this when we took seats nearby.\n\nI had chosen a tea that was not available in the self service area, but had I known about this area prior to my order I might have chosen an option that was self service for about half the price and zero wait. After tasting several of the self service teas, I was still satisfied with my choice.  It was a roibos red tea with the name coffee cake. It tasted a little like coffee and caramel. \n\nI really enjoyed the tea, and I love the inside of the restaurant. The decor is comfortable and upscale modern, with a huge display of olive oils available for tasting as well. I think they have a ways to go on customer interaction skills, especially when it was clear that we did not know how the ordering process worked and that we weren't even advised of the self-service bar. If this is their whole concept, and we were clearly newbies, why didn't she advise us?\n\nIn summary, I do like the concept, and the Self Service pricing is excellent. If you are ordering coffee or brewed tea expect $4 to $5 each. It seems like quite a splurge for me, seeing as how I have a pantry full of herbal teas. But for a nice atmosphere and comfortable seating to visit with a girlfriend, it is a nifty place.",

There are so many wonderful olive oil flavors to choose from including ones that I have never heard of before. \n\nNow the real tempting part is the tasty treats. Unlike Starbucks they are made in house. Today they had peppermint brownies which are my ultimate favorite but since I am trying to be good I settled with the gingersnap cookies. I bought three of them and they did not make it back to the office. Can't wait to try the other bake goods they offer.\n\nLet me mention they have a Tea Bar.

Parking is $6 so you make it up in 4 visits. \n\nWe have to spend most of our time in the two kid sections which can get very crowded on the weekends, and the bigger kids do get mean and pushy sometimes. I find myself policing other people's children. Where are the parents?!?!\n\nThe good news is that the park is really fun! We all have a great time whenever we go. My husband and I--and other adults who are with us, if applicable--take turns going on the slides. The fact that you can ride single and double is fun. The white and blue tubes in the middle are my favs. The new Dragon ride is meh. The line is long, and the ride is short. I'm also not such a fan of the one where you land in a pool in the middle and then get pushed by someone into another tube, but you'll just have to experience that for yourself.\n\nWe also like Mon Tsunami, the wave pool. We are really strong swimmers so we just go way out into the deep end to avoid the crowds.\n\nAs others have said, traffic on the bridge is slow on the weekends leading down to the Waterfront. However, I think it's been better this year than last year, I think. Everybody wants to get to the Waterfront on the weekends, not necessarily to go to Sandcastle.",

I anticipated that it might be due to the lack of them being open for a week and a half but thankfully I missed this weekends crowd it seems.\n\nThe misses to me was the lack of some of the rides being closed for what seemed like the majority of the day due to staffing (not maintenance), the gross waterpark food, and the signage.\n\nThe others are self explanatory, but the signage came into question at the Dragon ride. It clearly states that no more than 2 riders are permitted at a time, and that the heavier person rides in the back. That's cool and all, except it doesn't say 'no single riders' anywhere on the sign. It most certainly should, as more than once I saw single riders hike up the stairs only to return dejected after being told they couldn't ride. And I was one of them.\n\nOther than that, most slides were open with the exception of the two biggest body slides (no loss there; can't do them due to being a scaredy cat) and the two single tube slides closest to them (which opened later in the afternoon, about 3 hours after opening).\n\nDespite the food being poorly made but exactly what you'd expect at a water park, i did enjoy the beer I bought and was able to walk around the entire park with. That made it a little more fun!\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised to find regular swimming pools around. 1 for older kids/adults, a tad pool for babies, and a playset one for young kids (not including the lazy river or wave pool). I didn't expect that at a waterpark.\n\nI was asked by another park patron if I would consider buying a season pass after going for my first time, and my answer is still no.

The price for a small locker is $10, and I advise you to get a locker because you won't want to lug all of your things from place to place. However, if you are wanting to just stay and relax by the wave pool all day while your kids play around, it would be a great idea to just bring and leave your things at the wave pool. I would recommend getting to the park early to secure a wave pool resting place, or to get there around 2, when the park becomes less busy. Overall, the place is relaxing for the parents and fun for the kids. Buy your tickets online a few days in advance to get a discount. We were able to buy the $20 tickets, and I would say the experience was worth it for $20. But if I would've had to spend $35, I would say that it wasn't worth the price.

The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.

Most of the time we just hang out at the wave pool or relax on the lazy river. The food is good but I wish they offered some healthier options. They have a salad but that's about it. I'm not a major crazy health nut but something non-fried would be nice. If your not too worried about the calories their food is delicious, a bit overpriced, but your at an amusement park so what do you expect. \n\nThis year they have also been slacking on cleanliness. I've had to use the bathrooms a lot since I'm expecting and I wish they would send someone in more often throughout the day. \n\nOne other reviewer mentioned an adult area. Sadly they don't have this, but I think it would be great!!!  I usually visit on the weekend since I work weekdays and having children bump into you and splash you everywhere you go isn't very relaxing. \n\nThe staff is great. I have never seen a more attentive group of people. They are always on alert and I have no worries about the safety of the children in my family visiting with me when they can. I also plan on being my new baby next year and I have no fears about his well-being. \n\nHere are a few tips if you want to save $$$. Pack your lunch. See park rules on cooler sizes and don't pack any glass. On weekends/holidays get there when they open if you want good seats or a seat in the shade. If you plan on going more then twice buy a season pass, it will save you time and money. If you ever plan on bringing guests get a VIP pass for buddy tickets, parking pass and a souvenir cup. Souvenir cups are good if you like to drink something other then water they save you a ton on refills and you can use them all season long. Bring flip flops. The pavement gets scalding hot. I burnt the bottom of my feet the first time I was there this year. If you plan on coming late a lot bring your own folding lounge chair. After the opening rush on busy days they are all gone in the first hour. If you plan on having a group of 5 or more renting a cabana is really worth it, especially if you have older kids. It gives them a place to always find you. And finally buy your tickets ahead of time. It's always more expensive at the gate then online or at a local retailer. You can even buy your tickets online while standing I front of the gate. They can scan your ticket off your smart phone. \n\nNote to other guests... Please watch your children and don't rely on the lifeguards to babysit them. They are your responsibility. The lifeguards are there to keep them safe and alive but not respectful. Also please be courteous to others and only put your towels on chairs your using. I was late arriving last weekend (got there at noon) and sat next to 2 perfectly good lounge chairs with towels on them while I sat on the grass. For 6 hours I never noticed 1 person use them. \n\nI hope this helps!!",

I felt that the water was cold, but that's just a matter of my preference. The dressing room that I used in the Bathhouse was very dark and there were hygiene stickers from the inside of bathing suits all over the walls. The restrooms and changing areas near the wave pool were much cleaner and brighter. The food was mediocre and overpriced, except for the shaved ice near the wave pool.

I DO think it's a great place to take the fam or even, in my case, spend a day relaxing... if you can!  \n\nLet's do the compliment sandwich.  Positive - negative - positive!  \n\nThe negative... I feel like Sandcastle is the forgotten redheaded stepchild of Kennywood.  They keep pouring money into K-wood, but Sandcastle stays the same year after year.  Now, granted I haven't been there in YEARS, but everything seemed the same as I left it other than one new slide.  I haven't been there in about 9 years.  One new slide in 9 years?  Hmmmmm....\n\nI see major places to improve.  Especially the pool.  I honestly think the slides are great, although you could always add more, they're still fun.  The pool... it's just packed.  So packed that you'd think they'd add a second pool.  Looking around it looks like they have the extra space.  Maybe an adults only pool?  Swimming with 20 zillion kids, plus adults drinking (yes I like that you can bring your bevvie in the pool... but it's kinda weird being around so many kids) and you start to wonder how clean the water is.  I mean, 20 zillion kids you gotta expect a good amount of kiddos are peeing in the pool!  \n\nThe sidewalks are also scalding hot.  I'd assume since many of the people are walking around barefoot you'd be able to custom order some kind of non sun absorbing surface.  And I\"m NOT investing in those dorky water shoes, sorry!  \n\nI'm ALWAYS happy to see a Potato Patch stand!  Just as good as K-wood!  They also serve chicken tender, which is nice if you want a little meat to add on.  Nothing more is needed for me!  Although the frozen drinks looked tasty and tempting, it was so hot out I was just downing water by the gallons.  You're also allowed to bring in your own snacks and food, which I think is nice for families who want to save a little mola.  \n\nAgain, Sandcastle is so awesome to have in the Burgh, it would be nice to see improvements.  It always seems packed in the summer months, so why not keep on improving it?  Or maybe they think don't fix what's not broken.

There are just too many misses in my book though.\n\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \n\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place.

I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \"I'm an adult and you need to have some respect.\" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn!

Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\n\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\n\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \n\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\n\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \n\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets.

I called in because my debt card got lost and was using it for auto draft. I thought hey, let me use a checking account this time so i dont have to worry about lost debit card. The billing rep said checking account does not work anymore and to give him a new debit card so he can process the transaction.

I replaced the spark plugs myself and then my right front tire stated making a screeching metal sound when I would drive. My break pad was going out.  Then a few weeks later I had to pull over because the steering wheel was hard to turn. The power steering fluid had been leaking and the leak was because of a lose bolt on the hose that would never loosen on its own. It dripped fluid all over my belt and A/C unit. I've tried calling the guys about fixing the problem but they were going to charge me big bucks  although I JUST GOT THIS CAR I shouldn't be having these problems in two months. I asked to trade it in for another vehicle and the salesman said he knew nothing about it although I heard them saying you can. It's a horrible, sketchy place. They will mess  with the car so when you buy them you have to come back and pay extra money for it. The bolt?  No way it was loosened on its own.

Unfortunately, it was a mission to get it to produce smoke at the beginning. Most likely because the air valve was wonky. You could tell there was no ball bearing in the valve at times since the air kept escaping. How to know if there's no ball bearing? Blow on the shisha pipe, if air escapes from the sides = open valve. If it doesn't, you're good to go. Note to owner: invest in some ball bearings. BB pellets work fine, too. We had to use two coals to make up for it, which left the shisha chalky and gross within 20 minutes despite producing lots of smoke for a little while before that. Because of that, one star for the shisha. Only saving grace is the fact that the prices are pretty cheap and that the owner/sole employee was super sweet and welcoming, albeit did not look very professional as we didn't even know she was working there when we came in because she had her headphones in and feet up. Others would be offended, personally thought it was too beautiful of a day to be mad at her for it! And she was sweet afterwards. Help yourself to free water instead of having to wait for it! \n\nAll together, three stars for the beautiful decor; an eclectic mix of modern and traditional.

The \"Boys\" working on the grill and handling the food are very courteous and clean and smiling. Nothing is Filthy in that establishment.\nHave you ever seen a hog rolling in mud?

Both of them tasted amazing. \"Cheat on your diet and don't care\" type of good. This is the type of poutine you see on late night Food Channel from a famous food truck or some late night place, and that's a good thing.\n\nThey use the fresh-cut, skin-on type of potato for their fries and most items are supposedly gluten free, etc. \n\nOnly suggestion is if they added other types of fries to expand their menu like a Cauliflower poutine or even a simple sweet potato fries type of poutine.

The location is close to work and parking is not a problem in this plaza. Ordered the Phil Meal and got the poutine as well. \n\nThe cheesesteak was awesome - the only regret I have is not ordering the Philthy size! There was a lot of steak, and it was easy to chew. The mushrooms, onions and peppers, provolone cheese as well as the Philthy sauce (much better than your regular bbq sace) made up for the slight lack of flavor on the steak. (edit: I got lettuce and tomato as well, but thought it didn't fit too with the cheesesteak and ate them on the side.) The poutine had plenty of cheese curds considering its size, and the fries did not seem overly oily. \n\nAt 9.99 for a 6 inch cheesesteak, fries (+$2 for poutine) and a drink, you can't really go wrong (dare I say the value is Philthy?). I was hoping there was an option to upgrade the size of the cheesesteak similar to the fries, but it was a good mix of both of the main offerings.\n\nEven as a fast food sit down spot, the service was attentive and friendly.

No Phucking around!!

D-LISH!\n\nThere are approximately 8 different varieties of poutine ranging from original to a bacon steak burger (yes bacon and steak on poutine). And if that's not enough food for you, you've got about 6-8 variations of cheesesteaks to choose from as well.\n\nI always feel it's best to evaluate a food style on it's basics and then expand from there. I went for their supreme philly which was PHILTHY (in a good way). It's exactly as they're made in Philadelphia right down to being coated in Whiz (cheese Whiz that IZ...). You get 6oz of steak, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers all on a fresh top cut bun, and if whiz iznt your thing, no worries you have 3 other cheese options available to you (Cheddar, Swiss OR Provolone).\n\nFor my money this was a fantastic sandwich, and for only being 6 months young, they've got a concept that I know is going to be a huge hit here in the 'burbs and beyond!\n\nLooking forward to many a philthy meal in the phuture!\n\nEatcrest Out!",

For one, on Wednesday night they have 1/2 off bottles of wine. And although I can agree with Scott that there is nothing on the wine list that I go crazy over, the Pinot Grigio is fine by me. Especially when it's 1/2 off.\n\n I love walking in because it's so cozy. There are plush chairs and comfortable couches to sit in rather than a disarray of bar stools. The lights are dim and you feel like you're at home in your own living room. Very relaxed atmosphere. \n\nI really wouldn't go there to eat. I have had food there before, it's not bad. But it does take long and I think it's a little overpriced for the portions they give you. My friend noticed that the portions had gone down in size since the last time she ordered something. I guess it wouldn't be bad to split a few appetizers, but you'd definitely need a few.",

I had a Frozen Grape martini and it might have been the best one I've ever had. Very crisp, fresh, and over all delicious with a natural grape flavor.

It's unique as well with French bistro lighting strung up and cafe tables that are always packed.  In the winter it is a cozy place to be with lots of bench seating and a fireplace that blasts heat all night long.  \n\nTheir wine list is kinda laughable since it is called a wine bar, but I guess that it would please the masses.  I just really don't ever find anything that is interesting on their list in red or white. The rest of the booze taste just fine to me and they make one mean double dirty martini on the rocks with blue cheese stuffed olives.  A couple of those and I might just order a glass of wine.\n\nThe nibbles are good, but you will wait for a while since they come from the restaurants around them- Gamekeepers and West End.  We have always been a fan of the cheese board.  They used to have these tenderloin bites as well that were just fantastic.  Not sure what happened to those.\n\nThe best draw to this place is the bartender Jen.  She is fantastic, conscientious and funny.  I don't think that she is there anymore, so hopefully they found someone to replace her who is just as good.  Whenever we went I didn't even have to order- my dirty just showed up.

Once I was inside though, I loved the quaint and modern atmosphere. Definitely experienced a don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover moment. \n\nThe wine that was recommended to me, some Argentinian red wine, was okay. After that I had various glasses of white wine, and I loved it. I'm probably biased though, since red isn't my preferred choice. \n\nService was great. They often came over to see if we needed refills. Bathrooms are located upstairs. I had to scale some steep steps to get there, which felt like an adventure after multiple glasses of wine.",

We were checked in by Mr. Stormie Daye.  He was friendly,  efficient and informative.  Poolside service,  Blake was wonderful.   He made extra efforts and offered great advice. We ordered pizza from the Caribe and it was very good quality.  Everyone greets you.  That's great. \n\nThe rooms are wonderful.  Our room was like a one bedroom apartment with a dining area and full kitchen. We saved money by buying groceries and cooking breakfast and having drinks and snacks on hand.   There were 2 full baths. Master bath has a huge jetted tub. The balcony is large. There is a bedroom separate from the living area. The bed was comfortable.  There are 2 tv's, so no sharing. The pull out couch is an awesome asset. Lastly the room is well lit.   \n\nThe pool area is amazing.  Amazing!   Unlike some other hotels you can actually swim in this pool. It's large enough. There are 2 sides.  One larger size with the water fall which you can swim under. This pool also has the restaurant right next to the pool.  The other side has 4 water slides. 2 smaller ones and 2 larger ones. Plus another small swim area. There are 5 hot tubs located throughout.  There are many places to sit,  chill or eat plus hammocks.  Lots of shade. There is a huge bbq area near the pool with dining table near by. \n\nOther great amenities. ..an activity room with billiards,  24 hour business center,  plenty of luggage trollies, very clean resort and good security. \n\nNegatives. There are not a lot. When dialing 0 for service,  long wait.  At one point no answer.   It seemed to take awhile to get something delivered like towels.   I'm not sure I understand why we need cards for pool towels.  The cards are not guest specific so there really isn't any control.   \n\n If the resort reads these reviews,  there are a few suggestions.   We ate our pizza on our balcony to enjoy the evening. It would be nice to have an outdoor dining set out there rather than just the 2 chairs and small side table.   There is enough room for a table and 4 chairs.\n\nAgain, not a lot of negatives.  They are very minor compared to the positives.  Great place!!",

It doesn't surprise me though with the level of service we've had this entire trip here. This is actually the second time we have been completely ignored in this restaurant. Once the staff did finally assist us they were very nice. Until we started getting our food in to go containers? Apparently they had run out of clean plates which coincides with the fact that they had also run out of clean towels for the pool two days in a row. We received our bill and instead of charging us the two for one happy hour they had charged every drink individually. Seems like an odd slip for something they do every day.\nWhen we checked in we we're directed to check in at the VIP lounge. Which I guess is code for you own time share so we're gonna aggressively pressure you for an additional 20 minutes before giving you your room key into taking a seminar to buy MORE time share! My fiancé repeated numerous times that we were here with a group and would need to see what everyone did before we made solid plans.\nWe proceeded to get into our room and from that point we received 2 calls daily for 5 days to ask us to come to the front desk for our welcome packet and when would we like to sign up for the tour?. No joke twice a day! Last night my fiancé said to the woman on the phone \"as I said if I have time I'll come down and let you know\" her response....\"well your on the phone now\" at this point I'm tired and pregnant and not feeling well I have to be honest it's lucky I handed the phone to my fiancé cause had that been me I would have lost it. \nThe rooms were nice good ac. It was awesome having a jacuzzi tub in both bathrooms. However we had to put a service call in the one in our bathroom didn't work. Also each room had a balcony which is nice but my fiancés brothers room had a faulty latch and he was locked out a few times and had to wait for the desk to pick up for about 15 minutes or so stuck outside.\nThe wifi service is terrible!! Absolutely horrible!! You may as well just stay off of it. When all was said and done this is a nice place with a big clean pool but we will not be staying here again check out Tahiti Village it's right down the street.",

They were not in the same building and our building smelled like pot the whole time we stayed there. On top of that they hound you and hound you to buy a time share. Was not happy about them calling my mother hot mama, sexy mama. Having adults use the luggage cart to ride up and down the hallway running into walls. There was not cabinet doors in our kitchen. I will never, never, never stay there again. Was so upset how everything turned out there. Cancun Resort needs to improve a lot and learn how to treat their customers.

The bar/cantina was small and the service very slow. \n\nThe above items weren't even the worst part.\n\nWe checked into the Penthouse suite,  thinking it would be very nice.

High potential of breaking your neck!  \nThe blinds in the room do not close out light. \nThe jacuzzi in the patio was not operational. \nThe room had not been stocked with items like salt, coffee, soap, ..... basic items that are normally provided.  \n\nThe Time Share update,  was another high pressure sales pitch.  We got to tell four different sales people NO! before we finally got to leave.  If you go to this slate around 2 1/2 hours. \n\nAll in all a very disappointing first few days.

The pool was great, no major complaints there. So, the star rating is mainly for that. However, their customer service definitely needs work because we don't feel like coming back anymore. We know about their affiliation with a timeshare group, so we expected a membership sale from them. This was not our first time at this place. So, the staff who helped us checkout, did her sales pitch and told us all the wonderful benefits. We kept listening, then she mentioned a fee we needed to pay in order to get the offer. So, naturally we said no thank you and we'll think about it. But she kept insisting and wouldn't stop with the attempt. We declined politely so many times but she kept trying to convince us. My husband was fed up and just started to walk away while politely declining her offer. Then, instead of a \" thank you for staying with us\" to end it, she just said \"well, I guess you guys don't want the free stay, have a great day.\"\n\nThat type of service, regardless if it was towards the end of the stay, is still important because you want your guest to come back and hopefully those who declined the timeshare offer before would accept it. Not pressure them into signing up or keep insisting after declining the offer. Funny thing was, she first asked us how our stay was and we said excellent, then this happened. The encounter we had with her turned our good stay with them to a not-so-good-not-coming-back feel.",

They  allow pets (which is nice) but no one picks up the dog poop. It's all over the property and it smells horrible. The parking is a nightmare, my room had no bathroom lights and no blankets for the fold out sofa. It took 5 hours and 3 phone calls to get bedding, my bathroom lights were fixed the night before we left.  They trick you after you check in by sending you to the \"concierge\" for your check in package- it's a timeshare presentation and show sales, they aren't nice when you say you're not interested. They are high pressure and get snotty when you want to leave!  I feel like I was scammed by false advertising. I really don't want apologies and an invitation back after they finish the much needed renovation. I want a partial refund for the  false advertising. It's not worth the money. The best thing there is the water slide and the pool, but be warned, the water slides have a bad odor! The landings need to be cleaned and sanitized. The wait staff at the pools is non existent. The staff seem friendly enough but they all appear to be embarrassed when you talk to them about the issues, they all seem to know  the property is run down and not managed properly. I understand the people I talked to have no control over the operational side but I wonder if anyone in upper management truly cares.  If you can get a rate for $59 a night it's worth it- I paid $189 and feel like it was a HUGE rip off.  I've stayed at MUCH nicer resorts and hotels for the same price or less.

LOL Anyways.... I wanted a hotel that was off the strip and family friendly without a casino, kids have bad allergies and casinos are all bad for that. So I found a groupon for a 2 bedroom villa for $345 for 3 nights 4 days. I thought that was an awesome deal!\n\nArrived on Monday, early and requested to check in early, the gentleman at the counter was very nice and said that wasn't an issue and got us our room early. After check in your escorted to another counter (timeshare) there was a gentleman there asking us to go the presentation and I said no, if we did it would be on the last day and thats not likely. He didnt pressure us, said heres your free kids dinner and drink passes and we were on our way.\n\nUpon checking into our room, 2232, 2nd floor room. It smelt like curry, possible and indian guest was there before us. Room was clean, had everything you need, cooking stuff, plates, coffee maker, everything! We settled in and walked across the street to the grocery store and stocked up! Loved the fact that there was a full kitchen! Awesome! Beds were okay, kinda stiff but not bad. Cable in the rooms and free wifi for 4 phones! All worked well and we had no issues. the rooms are outdated and could use some better upkeep but it did the job for us.\n\nWe spent our days at the pool which was AWESOME kids loved it! The slides were a big hit! They have a gift store which I found to be reasonable priced. Beer there is so much cheaper then going into the bar, so my tip is buy beer at the gift store! Plenty of sitting for the pool area which was great. I wish they had servers though, if you do want a drink you have to go to the bar. The restaurant was ok-good and I didn't think pricing was extreme at all. I will say though, one day they had offered a coconut drink, when I ordered it, the girl couldn't open the coconuts to make the drink so she just said sorry we can't make them.... well don't offer them if you can make it LOL or go ask for help! They also have buy one drink get the second free and happy hour times, however its only on there very basic drinks..... also another tip we learned at the end, for the kids sodas, have them save there cups because refills are free! I didn't no and no one told us so I kept buying them each time! UGH I guess I should have asked, I found out on our last day to just save the cups.\n\nAt night, we went to the strip at night and Fremont street, we took Lyft which was anywhere from $23-35 bucks each way... it was little much but we wanted off the strip so thats what you get LOL I guess the resort use to have a shuttle, I think that would have been awesome if they bring that back!\n\nUpon check out, it was easy and there was no extra charges or anything. I would come back here again if I was bringing kids or family with elderly people because it is very low key and relaxed. We enjoyed our selfs very much!",

For us, and I speak for my family, it worked out beautifully. \n\nWe came with a group of friends occupying a couple 2 bedroom apartment/condo-esque rooms. Las Vegas from what I'm observing, is making staying in the city of sin much more accommodating for visitors staying beyond the weekend evidenced by all the 4-5 diamond non casino hotels. Our rooms came equipped with two bathrooms, two bedrooms, a dining room, kitchen and living room with pull out couch. It comfortably housed 6-8 people.\n\nThe resort itself if huge and we had to go through several buildings to get to the main lobby, front desk or to their administrative office for information about their time-share residency option. What stood out for our party was their amazing pool and water slide which the fellas could not get enough of. I'm certain they hit the pool several times a day taking breaks to eat and rest. Overall it'sa good place to stay away from the traffic, close enough in proximity to hit the strip and walk to the market for all your needs.",

We stayed in a \"penthouse\" and even had a jacuzzi which wasn't put to use because it was so cold outside. I thought it was funny how they referred to this room as a \"penthouse\" even though it was located on the third floor and not the top. The room was equipped with 2 bathrooms which had their own spa like tub, the one in the master bath could've fit maybe 4-6 people while the other one could fit 2 comfortably. One thing I didn't like about the other bathroom is that because it was a handicapped equipped bathroom when you showered the water would flow out and onto the bathroom floor. They should've buit the drain of the shower to in a way that the water would easily flow down the drain as quickly as possible instead of flooding the bathroom floor as this would cause a major accident. We also had 2 king or was it cal king beds and a pull out couch bed in the living room, enough to sleep 6 people comfortably.\nAnother con I found was the bathroom setups. The master bath was huge which had a jacuzzi plus shower in one. If the curtains to this jacuzzi would cover it up it'd be easier to use the toilet in this room at the same time because this was the only toilet that had a separate door. The second bathroom had a toilet, shower and separate tub area but there was no door to separate the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. \n\n*Wish this timeshare was located closer to the strip because most of the time we took taxi's and it was about $30 (btwn 4-5ppl) each way including tip. If we stayed in the strip it would've only been half that with the tip.",

A half hour later someone showed up with a broom and dust pan. We had to insist that the floor be vacuumed because there was glass all over the carpet. The master bathroom was the only nice area. It was very large with a granite double vanity and large Jacuzzi tub.\n\nAs for the Pool / Barbecue area, there was construction going on so while sitting around the kiddie pool there were workers walking back and forth with wheel barrows. If you are planning on using the barbecue's, expect to get your cooler inspected by security. \n\nThe common areas (interior & exterior) also lacked decor and the hallway leading to our room smelled like a cat litter box.

(pictured)\n\nThe concrete leading from the parking lot into the resort was dirty with grease and other spots, and obviously hadn't been pressure washed in a very long time. (pictured)\n\nAC was controlled by an analog thermostat that was either on cold all the time, or heat all the time. It didn't stop when it reached a comfortable temperature, and since it was analog, you couldn't accurately set a temp. If you moved the thermostat above ambient, then the heat blew. If the temp was set below ambient, the the ac blew. It was impossible to ever reach a comfortable temperature and then hold that temperature.\n\nThe kitchen sink faucet was falling apart, and didn't work well. (pictured)\n\nThe shower faucet handle in the main bathroom was also loose and didn't work well.\n\nThe carpet in the unit was old, stained, and worn - with thread bare patches next to the tile carpet transition. (pictured)\n\nAlthough we had a pool view, it was essentially worthless - because the wall in front of the balcony was so high - you can't see a thing while sitting down! (pictured)\n\nBalconies are all very dirty, and haven't been cleaned in a very long time! So don't go out there barefoot (pictured)\n\nWi-fi is slow, and there are only two devices allowed on your wi-fi at a time. Otherwise, you have to pay daily fees for faster speed and 3 or more connected devices.\n\nAte at the restaurant, and the food is sub par. My 14 year old daughter and her friend love and devour French fries, BUT - the fries here are so bad they couldn't eat half of one order - together! Smoothies are very sweet and fake tasting.\n\nThe location is good if you don't want to be near the hustle and bustle of the strip - so maybe great for families with young children. BUT - there were no other teenagers for my 14 year olds to hang out with. We were so very bored and unimpressed with this property, that we canceled our stay mid stay and moved someplace else!\n\nWhile it is true that there are four slides, note that two are  little, and two are bigger. When we went, the biggest one was CLOSED - so for my 14 year olds, that meant only one slide. I think the slides are the main attraction for kids, and should be on Cancun's priority list for quick repair - so there is no excuse for one being closed!!!!\n\nThe jacuzzi under the waterfall was also closed when we were there ... \n\nI do not recommend this property!",

The master bathroom had a jacuzzi in it but the second bathroom just had a shower. And it was weird because there was nothing to cut off the shower area from the rest of the bathroom--no glass wall or curtain. But everything worked well, although the water pressure was not great for the shower. The balcony had a nice view of the pool area. We didn't go to the pool area so I can't comment on it but it did look nice. The main pool (Mayan Lagoon) is only open from April through October, but the small pool (Mayan Cove) is open year-round. We didn't utilise any of their spa services but they do have a spa so that's definitely something you can check out if you want.\n\nThis is definitely one of the nicer timeshare resorts that I've been to with Monarch Grand Vacations. Parking for one car was included with our reservation. They said any additional vehicles would have to be parked off-site. Like others have mentioned, daily housekeeping is not included. And the kitchen is a full kitchen with most necessities stocked, which is great if you want to cook anything during your vacation. This place fulfilled all our basic needs. It would have been nicer if it was closer to the Strip, but then again, it would also be a lot more expensive :P And no pets are allowed (with the exception of service animals).",

It's just a book of ads.\n\nOur concierge just didn't feel like bothering to give us the coupon book. Talked to another and she opened a drawer full and handed us 3 or 4 that she randomly selected.

You want me to call them myself?\"\n\nShe didn't freaking call them. \n\nEVERY front desk / concierge person is like this.\n\nDuring one call I got put on hold  for 15 min. and had 2 people ask me if I've been helped, and I said \"I'm waiting on ____ can you check if he's still there?\"\n\nThey responded by saying \"Oh, you're already helped then?\" and putting me back in hold. Finally the first guy I was talking with gets back on line and asks \"Have you been helped?\"\n\n\"YOU were helping me. DId you find out about the dry cleaning?\"\n\n\"I already told you about that.\"\n\n\"No, you said you were going to ask someone and then put me on hold.\"\n\n\"Oh. You're right, sorry. Well I don't know yet. I'll call you later.\"\n\nWe ordered room service and our food came to us cold, and the boy who ran it up had a runny nose and wiped it on the back of the hand he used to hold our food.\n\nHalf the staff just show up whenever they feel like it. Most of them are texting on their phones.\n\nAnd the cafe REALLY lost quality. They had burgers with fresh fruit salsa and black beans, and all kinds of interesting stuff. Now they serve soggy fries and their food just tastes microwaved. \n\nBecause we were told the pool opens late (not true), we wanted to hit the on-site gym in the mean time. Turns out they were moving the gym THAT day. When is it going to be ready? \"30 minutes.\" \"a couple hours.\" \"Check back tomorrow.\"\n\n2 yrs ago you could get REALLY good bloody marys and mimosas for $3 in the mornings.

Not to mention each of the last few trips id hear employees foul mouths on the grounds and in the the cafe. Food has been cold and slow to get. What's going on Monarch Resorts? You pitch us the big show to buy but for the last few years I see less and less good and more and more bad. Not very happy with this stay right now. What used to be a fun place has steadily got worse each trip. Will not be keeping this timeshare that's for sure. Sad thing is the way my GF's parents were treated at their check in, luckily for them they printed out their conformation to prove it all. Decided to eat breakfast there for the 1st time in awhile and what a waste, everything was cold, not warm but cold. Also being an owner it would be nice to be informed of any changes that take place, like when shuttles are no longer available and its nothing but cabs which is a huge inconvenience at about a minimum of $15 plus tip each trip.

The staff is always amazing, the food is good, and the kids LOVE the pool and water slides! Is it a typical Vegas hotel? NO. But what this means is that you don't have to deal with the traffic from LV Blvd, get to park fairly close to your room without having to walk through an overly crowded, smoky casino, and you basically get a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment complete with a kitchen for probably less than a typical room on the strip. I have been there and done that with the crazy Strip hotels and I am soo over it- this place is somewhere you can come to to actually feel like you are on a real relaxing vacation, yet all of the craziness of the Strip is right down the road whenever you choose to partake in the craziness. Will they try to entice you to see a presentation and attempt to sell you a time share? Yes. But believe me, the ownership has been worth it and even if you decide not to own, it incentives are always very good (Visa gift cards, free stays, dinner vouchers, free tickets for shows and events, comped bills at the lounge and cafe, etc.) and totally worth the hour or so of time that it takes to attend a presentation!

Housekeeping suggested they were ours & did not take responsibility for them. \n\n6)We had to move to a different room b/c of all our problems. The hotel did not offer to help with the move from one building to another. (6 people & a week work of groceries)\n\n7) You are only allowed 1 pool float per room, even if you do have 6 people. There are not enough chairs for all the people. \n\n8) They say shuttle takes 15 mins. But only had 1 working so we waiting a min of 30 mins. Due to location taxis from here to strip are a min of $20 but avg $40. \n\n9) The GM was very skittish & wasn't happy about having to comp us dinner & drinks for our troubles. \n\n10) After moving to our new room. My husband & I both began to experience itching, welts & redness from sleeping in our bed. The front desk suggested we must both be allergic to the detergent. We did not find that likely since we were fine in the last room's bed. We had hives for 4 days! After replacing the sheets they finally started to go away but that was our last day. Housekeeping didn't even put them on the bed, we had to ourselves!\n\nThe organization and planning of this hotel is a disgrace. After staying at this hotel I will NEVER purchase a timeshare. I will NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE! This is the worst hotel on the market. I am highly disappointed. Especially after reading so many great reviews. I could go on and on about how much this hotel ruined our trip but I will stop. I think you get the point. It was awful and completely ruined our trip.

I shared our history outlined above.  She then told us she would have to \"e-mail my boss\" and see if something could be done.  By the time she was finished checking us in--lo and behold--her boss \"answered\" her and we got our room.  Of course, we thanked her profusely for her service--not wanting her to mess anything up.\n\nSuzanne then informed me that we were going to lose thousands of points as of Jan. 1 (it was Dec. 29).  She said that they weren't rolled over.  I insisted that they were, and asked her to check my status.  She said she couldn't get access to my account--in fact, no one there could.  The only way I could get this rectified was to attend an owner's meeting the next morning.  Our schedule was full, and were not planning on attending a meeting, but she insisted that it was the only way to fix this and not lose our points.  Reluctantly, we agreed, and set it for 8:30 the next morning.  Suzanne reminded us not to miss it, or we would lose a $40 deposit she put on my credit card.  As we left, she came out into the hall to make sure that we remembered her name and how helpful she was for us, and she asked us to write something nice on the evaluation we would be receiving when we got home.\n\nWhen we got to our room, I went online and discovered that yes, all my points had been rolled over to 2017.  She lied to us to get us to attend a meeting the next morning, which we did, not wanting to lose $40.\n\nIn all the years I've worked with Diamond, this was the sleaziest, most unethical thing one of the employees has ever done.

I thought why not try somewhere quiet so that we can relax and have quality mother and daughter time. \nCab ride from LAS airport to the resort cost us about $20.\nFirst impression of the resort was... its a very small, family friendly and cozy Resort.\nWe stayed in 1bed room condo which had full kitchen, 2 bathroom, and the living room was made so that you can divide it up to use it as a second room with pull out sofa bed. oh. and... I loved the jacuzzi bath. \nSwimming pool was huge compared to the size of the resort. it had 3 water slides but only one of them was open to ride. I liked that they had separate hot tub jaccuzi for adults and kids. (Had 3 in the pool area) + 1 adult one. Also loved the hammock!! \nIt was pretty nice resort but..... because it is not really a high standard hotel like resort there are some flaws.\n- if you call room service or maid service it takes forever for them to get the work done. \n- room service menu is very simple\n- takes forever for the cab to get to the resort \nOh. it costs about $25-30 from the resort to the strip.\nSo if you are staying at the resort for couple days it is better to rent a car. :)\nAnd if you decide to bring your own car they have free parking too! \nIf you want a relaxing quiet time at LV I think it is an okay place to stay.

A minor flaw that I've found was that the balcony screen door bug seal was loose. Overall, the feel is kinda outdated. Nothing too special here but you do get the basics. \n\nThe fun factor here is their Aztec pyramid water slides. Sliding down the water tubes  will get you that adrenaline rush. The pool area is clean and relaxing. They do have strict safety rules at the pool. \n\nJust for staying, we did get two buy one drink get a second drink free complimentary coupon to use at the Caribe Lounge, which they did make us some really good Michelada's. When I used our last complimentary coupon the lady working the bar didn't honor it. \n\nIf you're looking for a family hotel without the Vegas craziness this place is it.

The location was ideal for my family: off the strip and only a 15 min drive when we wanted to be touristy. The resort was also right across the street from a grocery store and CVS, which was nice. \n\nIt is weird that you don't get housekeeping if you stay for less than 4 nights. You'd think in that case they would at least give you bigger trash cans! It was annoying to hunt for a place to empty out our trash as they don't tell you where.

They have a \"buffet\" that you have to pay $13 or so per head - kids under 8 are half the price. The buffet is a little bit less than half of what you would find at a Marriott or Hampton in. Food wasn't great; it was hard and almost like it's been sitting out for a while. They had only OJ and milk for drinks available, unless you want to get something to drink at the bar 9 in the morning.\n\nSo after breakfast, we went for a swim. The pool is nice. The water is kind of cloudy. The towel thing is confusing. You get 1 towel per towel card, and they take the card until you get the towel back. My sister is a lifeguard, and don't leave your kids alone here. She says they don't know what they are doing to the full extent. They're careless. I decided to sit out a little and went to the Starbucks they serve at the bar.

Nevertheless, positive minded, we headed in to check in.\n\nWhat a NIGHTMARE! We went to one line to be entered into the system then were sent to anther line to get our 'welcome packet'. The second line was simply a ploy. On the spot, we were being hard closed on timeshare packages.\n\nI explained to them we were staying at a family owned timeshare, therefore had no need to purchase. Oh no, that wasn't good enough. They went on and on. Honestly, I still feel bad, but they pushed me so hard that I had to get downright nasty and rude to them to shut them up. It still didn't work!\n\nWhat seemed like an eternity later, we finally had our room keys and towel keys (you need one to get a towel at the pool), and were off to our room.\n\nWe stayed in room 1460. It was a one bedroom with two bathrooms, a dining area, living room area and a decent kitchenette. It was cute, a bit dated and a highly tacky, but not too bad.\n\nThe kitchen had glasses, plates, forks, pots, pans, a blender, etc. we really had anything we could need including a dishwasher.

However, we could actually go out onto the balcony and sit, which is rare in Vegas.\n\nThe key cards deactivate easily, so we had to keep them ways from our cell phones and other electronics.  They didn't work well either, which sucked since you had to use them access the elevator.\n\nThe elevator SUCKED. It took forever to come and go, which is funny because it's only a four story building. I felt like it was going to get stuck multiple times.  At one point the fire alarm went off wen we were on the elevator and I absolutely lost my mind.  I was so happy to be out.\n\nThen pool area was really cool. It has four water slides. Two small, two tunnel style ones that really zip you! They were a lot of fun.\n\nIt wasn't crowded either time we went and the temperature in the water was pretty perfect.\n\nThere was no wait staff for drinks or snacks of any kind, but you can bring drinks down in plastic containers, which was pretty cool.\n\nThere was a cool waterfall and a few hot tubs as well, one behind the waterfall. \n\nOverall the pool area was great.\n\nAll in all, the facility was clean, the room was ok, the pool was nice, the overall experience was just ok though.

You might want to find a strip hotel deal and use your points somewhere \"more special?\" \n\nAs everyone says in their reviews, it's far from the strip and all that nervous action, which may be a good thing if \"you're me.\" But if you thrive on that \"Vegas Energy\", and you're hosting people who've never done Vegas... then I'd find something closer to the epicenter of The Strip, with casinos, whistles, bells and AYCE buffets! If you have kids with, then Cancun is certainly going to be less hectic, easier to get from room to pool, etc. \n\nAs Monarch owners, (this is a Monarch Grand Vacations Resort), we scoped out the three room options; the Penthouse, the Two-Bedroom and the One-Bedroom. The rooms are equivalent to most timeshare condo-apartments. Yes, they do have a large pool and obligatory excercise and recreational centers, but if you start comparing this to say, the \"Cabo Azul\" Monarch property in Cabo San Lucas, it certainly comes up short as a luxury resort. And it's not \"Vegas Luxury\" level, so don't expect to be knocked off your feet with glitz and glamour.\n\nAs a past resident of Vegas, and a regular business visitor, I have my short list of hotel properties that I frequent, and most are either timeshare resorts, or suite-hotels off the strip. And sometimes I'll stay in Henderson; anywhere that gets me away from the tourist traffic of Vegas Blvd. So only because Cancun is far from the maddening crowd, and offers timeshare condo style lodging, is it on my list.",

            "text" : "We walked into the Circus Circus lobby directly from the airport and immediately was accosted by a woman trying to sell us something. However, she didn't directly say what it was. Instead, she called it a \"vacation program\", and used phrases like, \"don't you enjoy traveling?\"  It did sound appealing, but my boyfriend was not thrilled. But because we don't live together - and therefore don't share finances - I could attend on my own. Attend, that is, after giving the woman a $20 \"deposit\" which would be returned to me at the presentation.  My sweetie had already gotten disgusted, and was trying to free us of the grasp of this woman so we could check in to the hotel. \n\nThe hotel was great, by the way - see my review of Circus Circus, which I posted earlier. But this is not about the hotel. \n\nI found myself the following morning waiting for a shuttle. There was about ten of us from the hotel, and eventually the shuttle arrived and we boarded, and after a couple other stops, made our way to Cancun Resort Las Vegas.  \n\nOn the way there, a woman gave a talk to us called Hidden Las Vegas, which I found quite interesting. She discussed the Mob Museum, which we went to, and a favorite local Italian restaurant, which was too far from our hotel, but maybe next time.  \n\nOnce we got to Cancun, we were led into a small theatre with a man doing this incredible presentation. Honestly, he should be on a stage there in Vegas, instead of selling timeshares - he would probably make more money. But he was so obviously into sales, and if he gets a percentage of all those who bought into this program on that day, then he is doing very well. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAfter the theatre presentation, where he enthusiastically talked about how good a deal this was, how much money we would save, and so on, we broke up into groups with our own individual salesperson.  My guy was Robert.  Robert was very nice, not pushy, and directed me to his iPad to look at various properties that I might want to visit.  He said he was getting married in March, and so I asked him where he was getting married, and where was he going for his honeymoon.  In Tucson, he replied, and it turns out he wasn't using this program for his honeymoon.  That was telling.  He was trying to sell me something that he wasn't using himself. I was getting a little suspicious.\n\nNext, Robert took me on a tour of the premises. It looked right out of a condo complex in West Los Angeles - you don't even think you're in Vegas at all. There was a gym, a pool, kids activities - but this is Vegas. I don't go to Vegas for a family vacation. I foist my child off to someone else for the weekend and go to Vegas sans child. If I wanted to stay in a place like this, I would go to Seattle - or Portland - or any number of other cities. \n\nNow I understand one can stay here without buying into the timeshare program, so that might be appealing to some families. \n\nBut I digress. The real issue is the price.  After discussing all the options, I said that I really couldn't afford any of them.  And I understood that the money had to be directly withdrawn from my account. That increased my suspicion a little more.  But of course this way the company gets paid every month, and gets paid first. Although I probably could have put that on a credit card - and gotten even more in debt. \n\nFinally, the manager came over, and said that the lowest price point they had was $190 a month.  Manager Bob, we'll call him, pressed me for information, and found out that he and I had both attended UC Berkeley.  However, my education at Cal taught me to think critically - which included saying no to buying a timeshare. I added that I was in the process of refinancing my house, something that would take a few months. He replied, \"Well, why don't you give me the numbers - I used to be a mortgage broker.\" \"No thanks,\" I replied, \"You're not my mortgage broker, and we're not in California.\"  With that I was, finally, free to leave.\n\nThe others in the group - about 25 or 30 people - all went back into the little theatre to celebrate buying something that they will probably regret.  And would have difficulty in selling even if they wanted to do so. A quick search online under \"how to sell a timeshare\" demonstrated this point very clearly.  Additionally, most timeshares are marketed to people who cannot afford them. Given the discussion in the theatre upon first arriving at Cancun, this was definitely the case. \n\nBesides, if I was paying $190 a month for something, I would much prefer to make a car payment. At least then I'd have something tangible to show for it. \n\nOn the way out, I did get my $20 back, as well as my complimentary gift - $100 gift certificate for Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere. Where we went for brunch the following day - and that was fantastic. We might even go back without a gift certificate. But that's another review.",

Concierge will help you book show tickets.\n\nCons:\nUpon checking in, it took a good 3 minutes for the front desk to acknowledge that we even walked in the building.

We were the only ones in line, nobody was around. They werent in the middle of a call or helping anyone in person. LOL! Not courteous at all.\n\nOur tub was clogged (gross). And parts of our room was falling apart. A piece of window blinds was missing on our bedroom window (not good for a couple on their honeymoon, thank you-- peep show?), so we threw a towel to cover the open spot.

The full kitchen was well-stocked with all the essentials including Cuisinart coffeemaker, blender and toaster. The only thing \"missing\" was a rice cooker, which we brought along. The beds (including the sofa sleeper) were newer and quite comfortable. The bathrooms are gigantic, including whirlpool tubs.\n\nThe Cancun Resort complex in which the unit sits, was virtually smoke-free, which is great for people travelling with children. There is a monstrous swimming pool at the heart of the resort with 4 water slides and plenty of room to swim around without feeling cramped. There is also a large game room off the lobby with pool tables, ping pong  and foosball. There is plenty of parking around the complex, including a limited number of underground spots for those (like me) who detest leaving my car out in 110+ degree sunshine.\n\nYes, this is a timeshare resort.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!\n\nFirst things first, as soon as you get off your car you are not greeted by any of their staff members. When you walk in the lobby the staff members all attack you to join their timeshare and do not even help you out to check in.\n\nSecond problem, we arrived to check in at 5pm and the rooms were still not ready for me to check in. Check in time is at 4pm how are the rooms not ready by this time???? \n\nThird problem was that I had reserved 5 rooms and wanted them to be charged to the same card. Apparently, the guy had to do 5 SEPERATE transactions because he could not do them all together, yes, my card was swiped 5 times! The worker (named Stormie according to his name tag)  said that I was making him work because I had booked 5 different rooms even though it was all one single reservation!. This made the process soooo much longer! I literally spent a whole hour and a half just to check in and the guy still did not offer to help me with my bags or show me where to park or give me any info about pools hours or anything. He just had TERRIBLE customer service skills! \n\nFourth problem, only 2 elevators for the whole building. These elevators are soooo slow! And to make things worse, only 1 was working. It would take like 15mins just to get to your room or to the 1st floor because the lines were to long to get into the elevator. \n\nFifth problem, I specifically had asked for a handicap accessible room with roll in shower. When I walk into my room what is the first thing I notice, no roll in shower!!! How is my guest supposed to shower if he CANT get into the HUGE/TALL bathtub???\nI called the front desk to inform them about this problem and they told me that there was nothing they could do because I did not request a roll in shower! Also that they could not switch my room because everything was booked.! I was beyond pissed by now! And the door for that bathroom was stuck inside the wall so we could not close the door!!\nThis place is NOT wheelchair friendly! \n\nOh the list of problems does not stop there and this is only within the first few hours that I have been at this place! \n\nSixth problem, the next day both sinks in the restroom clogged up. The only positive note on this was that they solved the problem fast.\n\nSeventh problem, as you may now by now, all room have a kitchen included, well we brought our own food and of course when you cook a meal, there is plenty of trash everywhere right? No cleaning staff member ever stopped by our room to clean and pickup the trash!!!. We called so that we can a set of clean towels, and so that they can come pick up the trash. Unfortunately, you have to wash your own towels in the laudry room!!! WTH! What kind of room service is that????!! I had never heard of having to wash my own towels at a RESORT! And they NEVER came to pick up the trash!!!\n\nEighth problem, the doors to the rooms do not close properly. At night you can see a huge gap on the door that you can see the people passing by!\n\nLastly, they tell you that wifi is free on the first 2 devices, yeah well thats not true! We were charged a fee for using it on 1 device!!!\n\n\nThis has been the worst resort I have ever stayed at!!! Never again will I stay here!\n\nThe only thing that is nice about this hotel are the pools and slides, even though they are not as clean as they should be. Even that does not make up for the TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! \n \nDont stay here! \n\nCustomer service is a key to keeping people happy! You should keep that in mind Cancun Resort!",

I guess I've been spoiled by my usual place ( The Signature) I stay when visiting Las Vegas but to me it makes a difference.  The rooms seemed to have been remodeled but in a hurry or plainly just half assed. The door frame to my room was broken and I needed to lift the door to be able to close it. The water faucets leaked and the shower head in one of the bathrooms sprayed water all over the place when turned on.  The bathtub is really hard to get into because the tub is a jacuzzi and its deep and is really  high specially if you are of normal height (5'8) or have children. The parking to the rooms seems to be unguarded and it gives me the vibe of a run down motel. \n\nThe resort is far from the strip but that isn't necessarily bad as long as you know this.  I think the worst thing about this place would be the slippery floor by the pool.  I know people might say this is exaggeration but it's not. I think the floor is so slippery to the point that it is unsafe and as a parent this is a complete deal breaker. As far as the pools go they are very nice but bring your own towels. The resort offers towels by the pool but you have to bring a towel card ( provided at check in) that you must turn in when getting a towel and return towel to get card back ($25 fee if card lost).

I was ushered to check in immediately upon entering the lobby at 1600, which is the weirdly late check in time. It took about 15 minutes to get me checked in and they put a hold of $100 for damages on my credit card in addition to the purchase price. They let me pick what view I wanted and let me know that check out is at 1000, really early! Also the pool is only open from 0900 to 1800, apparently they really don't want anyone using it.  \n\nAfter getting my keys and other information I was given a strange paper that proclaimed me to have diamond points and was told to see the concierge to finish check in. I thought that was odd but went over anyway to see what was up. Once I realized that they were trying to sell me a timeshare and other nonsense I said that I did not want a welcome packet (waste of paper) and that I was all set. The concierge was aghast that I didn't want the packet which is supposedly full of discounts and other things. She tried to convince me to take the packet and hear the speech but I was firm with my no thank you and went on my way. I think that they are used to a captive audience since the front desk made it seem like I had to go through the process for check in, which is not true. \n\nI then had to go out the front doors, walk around the building and into the parking garage of my assigned tower. The elevators are accessed from the underground parking garage and they are very slow, which is unfortunate because I could not find the stairs anywhere and I searched for them for the 5+ minutes that it took the elevator to arrive. \n\nThe room itself is OK. The fixtures are dated, there is quite a bit of road noise but it isn't unbearable. This would be a good place for families as there are two bathrooms, one attached to the master bedroom with a shower and tub, and one off of the living room with a shower. There is also a small but serviceable kitchen with full size appliances and a dining room. The couch in the living room is a fold out and there are sliding screens to close it off from the rest of the \"villa\".  Also they try to sell you on the upgraded WiFi - for only $2.95 a day! - it is unnecessary. My husband was uploading pictures while I surfed the web and the free internet was plenty fast.\n\nPros:\nLarge rooms\nFull kitchen\nCheap\nOversize vehicle parking and parking garage\n\nCons:\nWeird front desk greeting\nSales pitches\nOnly 3 hours to use the pool\nRooms are difficult to access",

There is no \"adult\" pool. There aren't any real separate pools, just the side with the water slides and the side with out the water slides. \n\n2) METAL POOL CHAIRS!? Seriously!? Pool chairs with metal frames in VEGAS. Talk about burning your skin. Or as my friend so dramatically put it while sitting up to go into the pool \"Why does Cancun Resort hate me?\"\n\n3) Only 6 towels per room. Which would be fine if you had 3 people. You need 2 towels for the pool: 1 to lay out on and 1 to cover the metal pool chairs that conspire to burn off any bits of skin that may come into contact with them. We had 5 people, I had to argue for my extra towels. \n\n4) The \"life guards\" (aka high school kids on summer break) went around randomly closing umbrella's with no explanation. Hello? This is Vegas, I am pushing 30 give me some shade!!! Its like the drug companies paid them to force us all to have cancer. In the words of Stephanie Tanner \"How Rude!\"\n\n5) No outside food or drink in the pool area, but you CAN purchase drinks from their bar. Ummm... NO! We brought our own stuff and no one said anything. So I guess this is a wash, but just the hypocrisy of the sign irritated me. \n\n6) The time share sales staff are the most unorganized, non-helpful bunch. We were committed to listening to an hour and a half speal about how great the resort was, when we tried to move the time the girl in the sales office was unhelpful and didn't change our time slot (luckily if you start complaining about all the things that need to be fixed your 1.5 hour tour turns into 5 minutes. SWEET!)\n\n7) Location is meh if you want to go to the strip. They do have shuttles which are awesome and we never waited long for, but they stop running at midnight, which sucks in Vegas. It is a 20 dollar cab ride back from the strip. Plus, when you're that far away you have to plan going to the strip not just walk down stairs. Which is kind of a bummer. \n\n8) Holy Tattoo's! I am not one to be totally judgmental because I myself have a few strategically placed ink, but wow. I saw more ink and young people with babies here then anywhere else in my life. It is definitely a \"different\" crowed then you would find at the MGM, Planet Hollywood, or even say Hooters. If you have ink and lots of babies, awesome. It just wasn't the scene I was expecting. \n\nAll and all, not a horrible experience, but I would never pay to stay here (this trip was free thankfully), if it were offered as a free trip again I think I would pass and pay to stay at Planet Hollywood, MGM, or even Hooters over this place. \n\nThanks for the weekend Cancun, but no thanks.",

When I just get off a plane and arrive at my hotel, I want to get up to my room, not  be pressured into scheduling another sales pitch.\nAside from check in though, this place us amazing!",

            "text" : "AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!  I would NOT recommend the Cancun Resort / Diamond Resort Hotel and the issue is not the resort itself but the sales staff and their tactics.  When I am on vacation, the last thing I want to do is listen to a timeshare pitch camouflaged by such terms like \"Welcome Packet, \"Welcome Package\", and \"Departure Gift\".  When you have to tell them that you are not interested multiple times, THAT is a problem.  ...there was even a guy at the front door that attempted to intercept my decline, \"Hey, did you get your welcome packet and discount coupons?\"  Then he followed that up with, \"Oh, you like to pay full price?\"  That was as tacky as it was comical and the fact is, I would much MUCH rather pay full price (on a meal, minus a coupon) than have to listen to a sales pitch when I am trying to enjoy myself.  As if they couldn't get any further from me returning to the Cancun Resort or purchasing anything from Diamond Resort International, we get a call on the last morning but AFTER I had already called the front desk and checked out over the phone... to be sure to pickup a \"departure gift\" while dropping off my keys at the front desk (which I had already made arrangements for).  Oh brother...  If you are anything like me, this kind of annoying persistence just doesn't work and frankly promotes opposite the desired result.  This process puts a dark shadow over and certainly takes away from what should be an enjoyable experience.  And so there isn't any confusion, I will not be returning.  The property would have fared much better simply speaking for itself.  In my opinion, they should try that.   \n\nNow, the reason why I did not rate the Cancun Resort lower is because I was greeted by a most excellent (helpful, sincere) front desk person whom I would name but I think the Yelp review guidelines (Privacy section) discourage that.  And actually, the rest of the hotel staff that I interfaced with seemed pleasant.  With all due respect, the Villa / Room and the pool were nice so it is a shame that my experience with the sales staff will serve as a \"deal breaker\".\n\nI will add that I booked directly on the Cancun Resort / Diamond Resort and Hotel site and did not receive any special pricing in lieu of a sales presentation.  It appears as if you are going to get the unfortunate sales pitch no matter how you book your stay, discount special or not.  If you go, expect to be targeted as soon as soon you walk in the door.  NOT WORTH IT TO ME.  I'll take my vacation elsewhere.",

            "text" : "Where do I start? My husband and I are current owners for another resort and love it. We were offered a four day....three night stay with Diamond Resorts in order to preview their resort. Due to the holiday weekend we had to get managers approval in order to get a room at the Cancun Resort due to non-availability. I was impressed that they gave us the place that \"owners\" stay at. I figured it would be top notch since \"typically only owners are allowed to stay here\". I actually had came here for a tour when this resort was first built 14 years ago and owned by another company. \n\nWhen we first pulled up to the resort I was impressed from the outside appearance. I was baffled when I spoke with guest services because, the girl acted like she didn't know what I was saying when I asked for an adjoining room and that I was new and had never stayed here before. I am pretty sure I repeated myself a few times. This resort does not have adjoining rooms. Meaning that if you had another couple....several kids....etc....you would have to hope and pray that they could get something on the same floor, etc. \n\nThe outside pool area is nice. The restaurant by the pool is small and has minimal seating. They do deliver to your room but, they do not have to go menus. Their prices are similar to Applebee's and their food selection is wide. Towels seem inconvenient since you have to have a towel card in order to get a towel from the gym located on the opposite side of the resort from where we are staying in building #2.\n\nThe internet is mind boggling. Our resort and many like it have unlimited wifi for multiple devices. Not this one though. The first two devices are free but, each additional one ranges from $2.95 and then $5.95 each per day for standard wifi.  Say what???!!! That means only two members of my four member family plus one friend staying with us can use the wifi or else have to pay use it. That equates to one laptop, one cell phone and nothing else. We paid the first $2.95 so that my son could play online too but, my tablet would cost an additional $5.95 for one day if usage. Ummmm.....no thank you. Not to mention the internet falls offline continuously.\n\nWhat is that smell???!!! This building or at least the third floor smells like an ashtray that was once wet and allowed to dry for an extended period of time. We actually went to the store and bought some febreeze air freshener. My youngest said that it reminds him of the nasty peanut  butter sandwiches that his school serves. Sadly it's not just the hallway but, our room too that smells like this.\n\nThe ice machine on our floor does not work. The room only had ice trays. The elevator has no ventilation so it feels like a hot sauna during the daytime. Can it get worse?\n\nThey do have a free washer and dryer located by the broken ice machine. Nice to have yes but, it takes years to dry your clothes. Fortunately no one ran off with our clothes.\n\nThe pool is nice but it is frigid. My normal water babies only did 10 minutes in the pool and refused to go back because it was too cold. It is confusing since Vegas was almost 110 degrees during our visit. \n\nSince we were unable to get a secondary room for our friend....she brought a queen sized air mattress to sleep on. I called room service to bring a pillow, a sheet and two blankets. They said that it would be here within 20 minutes. 50 minutes later......Nothing. I called guest services and was told that my request was already delivered earlier. I asked which room because it wasn't this one. After getting up to make a 3rd call after another 30 minute wait, there was finally a knock at my door. Finally! We could all get some shut eye. \n\nMy friend went to her car and watched one of the handymen pour a bucket of water on their hallway carpet and then proceed to buff the floor with a hard floor buffer. That could be why it smells so bad throughout the building. The carpet is old and tattered and now it seems to make sense of why. Bonus....He must have added Febreeze because the first floor now smells nice.....or least by the main entrance.\n\nAhhhh the whole point of our stay.......The sales pitch. Of course they showed us the \"nice\" rooms with the febreeze smelling hallways. Their hospitality quickly changed and I am sure horns appeared when we told them \"We're not interested\". Why? We love our current company. We didn't even get a good bye from them. Just a very quick escort to their incentives desk and not so much as a \"Bye Felicia\". The other ratings are correct folks. They treat you like poo when you refuse to come to their side.",

We took advantage of the grills that are available towards the back of the pool, and let me say, my husband would be proud to grill on those grills!  They were clean and fired up great so our food was able to cook to perfection!  And they loan you set of grilling tongs & spatula so you're all set with no worries!

The Cancun is a time share!  The room was dirty, dingy and requires repair and updates.  There were stains on the carpet, broken furniture (including missing handles on drawers, etc.).  I found a used soap w/hair in the master bathroom!  My two young daughters found a wad of blonde hair when they picked up the hair dryer.  There was gum on the ceiling!  If you  and stains on the floor.  If you decide to stay at this hotel, make sure to bring your own toiletries; strangely enough, The Cancun provided two shower gels,  one conditioner and a lotion, but no shampoo.  (I thought perhaps the cleaning crew made a mistake and provided two shower gels and forgot the shampoo; but the other bathroom was the same way).  The pool had large groups of people - many were drinking alcohol and left bottles and plastic cups around the pool.  Beware if you have a family which utilizes electronic devices w/wifi- only two devices are allowed wifi for free and there is an additional charge for every device thereafter.  Also, there was limited parking near your room.  I would not recommend this hotel.  We didn't even stay the night.  I found another hotel and left.  I called Expedia to advise the situation, but they would only provide $50 of Expedia credit to use in the future.  I wouldn't recommend Expedia either.  We lost appx. $450 ($400 w/credit)  I don't normally write reviews, but didn't want another family to get \"tricked\" and lose money like we did.

I actually attended a timeshare presentation and this was one of the resorts being pitched by the timeshare company. They pitched this one because I indicated I liked to go to Vegas. \nThe timeshare company \"Pacific Monarch\" pitched this place as heaven on earth and would be worth paying like $30,000 so I could stay here and there other resorts. BS. Did some research on this place so I can make sure that no one else falls for this scam or worse actually books this place to stay off a site like Expedia or Hotwire, etc.\n1.) This \"resort\" is 6 miles south of Mandalay Bay. You are farther away from the beginning of the strip than the Stratosphere is from Mandalay Bay. \n2.) There is no shuttle to take you to The Strip. Vegas taxis ain't cheap and do you really want to take the bus on your vacation?\n3.) Was curious to see how prices stack up on an off-peak weekday. \nWas quoted $159 for a small outdated looking 1 bedroom \"Villa\" on Pacifc Monarch's site.  For $159 and less you could stay at the following Strip Resorts: \n\nBellagio or Nobu ($159)\nPalazzo or Venetian ($149)\nWynn ($139)\nEncore ($132)\nAria ($114)\nThe Signature at MGM Grand or Vdara ($99)\nCaesars Palace ($95)\nTrump ($90)\nThe Hotel at Mandalay Bay ($85)\nTropicana ($71)\nMirage ($69)\nPlanet Hollywood ($67)\nMandalay Bay ($65)\nTI ($62)\nMGM and Paris ($60)\n\nSo same price or less for better accommodations, not having to spend money on transportation, and actually getting to be in Vegas not Vegas Adj.

We are 6 guys, our friend said that it can sleep that many comfortably.  We all agreed, it sounded great. A penthouse on Las Vegas Blvd with a free shuttle to the main part of the strip for only the cleaning fee! \n\n      Well as it turns out if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  We arrived at Cancun to find out that the cleaning fee was $280!! WTF? We could have got a couple of rooms on the strip for that alone. I later learned that the room cost my friend a hundred and thirty points which are a couple bucks each! That is some BS! For someone who supposedly is an \"owner\" this room sure cost a hell of a lot! \n\n     Next on the long list of disappointments. We specified that we were six guys and were not interested in sharing beds. We wanted rooms with twin beds. When we arrived sure enough both bedrooms had kings and the only other bed was the fold away sofa. We asked and they do not offer roll away beds! \n\n     Next up NO MF'ing shuttle to the strip! Ok now seriously WTF? This complex is at least 5 miles from anywhere interesting. It's a $25 cab ride too and from anywhere on the strip. So every time you want to go anyplace you're looking at $50 out of pocket, unless you want to drive, but who the hell wants to drive in Vegas? I want to be able to have a couple of drinks and not worry about having to remember where I left my car the next day. This whole \"resort\" is BS!\n\nThen there are the rooms. The \"penthouse\" was nicely appointed. It had a small kitchen a nice living room/dining room combo and the beds were comfortable and it appeared clean (better be for $280 F'ing dollars!). But the bathrooms are ridiculously STUPID! The bathroom off of my bedroom had no privacy door, just open straight to the room. In both bathrooms there were jacuzzi hot tub/shower combos. Sounds great right? WRONG! I don't know what kind of brain damage the designer of these shower/tub combos was afflicted with but someone should have pointed out that people don't want to have to shimmy over a 2ft high ledge 18\" wide with no safety bars or handicap access to get into the shower. AND that the shower controls should be located somewhere near the shower head! Not 5ft away on the opposite wall! Also the shower head should not be pointed at the entrance/exit of the shower.  Oh the stupidity just keeps coming.\n\n  Next up, during the winter months there is Nothing to do at this place! The pool is closed the only restaurant is the snack joint under the pyramid. Which was okay. There is no gaming, no entertainment of any kind. A couple of us went to the spa and had a relaxation massage which was nice, probably the highlight of our time at Cancun.\n\n\n     I cannot stress this enough! Do yourself a favor DO NOT EVER BUY A TIMESHARE! They are the worst real estate investments you can possibly make.  If you've got one DUMP IT! Take the loss and get out! \n\n     Even the staff seems to know this place sucks! I think they wanted to help and were nice enough, but they knew there was nothing they could do. I could have overlooked just about everything if they just had a shuttle, after all it isn't my money that's being flushed down the drain every year, but come on!

Both visits have been pleasant and we have enjoyed them for the most part. The end of our last trip left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth and I'll explain why.\n    Upon check-in, we were propositioned to sit through their time-share circus show. We initially declined, but the 'gifts' they dangled in front of us were just too enticing for us to pass up for a 90 minute session of me saying \"No.\" Three days and two nights free, $125 gift card and a free breakfast for me and the wife? I'll take that deal. \n     Star swipe to the presentation, which was sales pitch to the EXTREME. It was like a scene out of Glengarry, Glenn Ross. Holy smokes! They herded us out of of there and handed us over to their sales people. We got some broad who was coming on way too strong for my taste. Told her from jump that we were NOT interested, but we didn't want to be rude and she could continue if she wanted. She did and here's how our conversation went down:\n\nMe: Yeah, I got a buddy who is an owner here.\nHer: \"Oh, yeah? He must be a really smart guy. Is he smart?\nMe: \"Nah, not really. I mean, he bought a timeshare!\" (ZING!) Pure comic GOLD!\nShe was NOT impressed (Subsequently, I have had several chuckles at that scenario).\n\n      This lady then proceeds to pull out her phone, shuffle through the pictures of her cat to find last year's sales numbers, shows me that her name was on the top of the list and tells me how she is the best salesperson there and then tells me what she makes. Then she says that she will close 6 out of 10 people and the other 4 \"Just can't afford it.\" After determining that I COULD afford it she hits me with this look like, \"...Soooo... Why aren't you buying...?\" My wife and I simultaneously said, \"We just aren't.\" (JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU WHEN WE STARTED!!!) She promptly shakes our hands and leaves. Point- Sam. \n     We had us a good laugh as we collected our gifts and left. All in all- we like the place, but those sales people are... They're really something. I will omit the long conversation had in the hot tub with a Diamond \"owner\" who is extremely dissatisfied with her ownership.\n     This being the case, we still like it here and will come back...

It was on the first floor of the hotel and had a full kitchen and supplies, fridge, gas cooktop and stove - there is a food 4 less across the street so you could easily cook if you want to.  There are two large pools and hot tubs on the property.  By far the best feature was the in room jacuzzi bath tub.  Bed was nice and comfortable and there was even a separate living room with a futon and divider - could have easily slept two couples with a reasonable amount of privacy for both.  There is a second bathroom with shower too off of the living room. Lots of kids with families.  There is a small bar (closes at 10p) which made an acceptable burger.  Cab was easy to obtain to the strip for about $35 each way including the tip.  Plenty of free parking.  After you check in you will be encouraged to visit the \"concierge desk\" for some coupons, and of course they want you to go to their time share talk.  If you don't care about coupons (we didn't end up using them) I would recommend skipping that stop.  In all it this hotel is convenient to the strip and much nicer and less expensive than anything u will find on the strip.  I would seriously consider it if you are in town for a conference.  As a tip - if you are careful about how you approach the strip it's actually pretty easy to drive - one night we went to the hard rock casino.  They had a free parking garage so we saved ourselves the $60 fee.  Of course, someone in your party needs to volunteer to be the DD, and you don't want to avoid Las Vegas blvd in your car as much as possible.",

Every minutes was painful to wait with 3 children. After 30 minutes I called back down and asked what was going on and the girls a few more minutes. I went into the hall and made an engineer come in and work on the room. Yes, I did interrupt him but my family was dying of heat. This is July in Vegas, we need air!

We booked there penthouse suite a month and a half in advance for a birthday party. The main reason we booked the room was because it had it's own private jacuzzi on the balcony. Well upon check in we realized our hot tub was no operable. I called and complained only to get that they would get back to me Saturday morning. Saturday morning came and went so I called again with no answer. Went to the front desk and spoke to the Director of Operations who sent someone to check it out. After having to be in my room for 2 hours while the rest of my party enjoyed the pool they finally tell me that the hot tub will need to be manually turned on and off by maintenance the rest of the weekend. So it wasn't a HUGE deal but I thought for the inconvenience they could at least comp back some money for the room and inconvenience. The Director of Operations only authorized at 40 dollar food and beverage credit which was baffling to say the least. She had the WORSE attitude ever basically saying that since we paid UPFRONT she wouldn't do anything to accommodate us. We had 6 people in our party how do we disperse 40 dollars to people who thought we would have a never closing private jacuzzi. Such a disappointment.. And by far THE WORSE customer service ever.. The DIRECTOR NEED TO BE FIRED!! and her counter part assistant manager can also take a hike as well. How about you find people who actually know how to satisfy there customers.. The elevator takes forever to come, They monitor your room calls and choose when they will or will not answer, They don't take any complaints seriously, and they think I HAVE TO STAY THERE AGAIN.

            "text" : "We got our room on groupon awhile ago and then decided to stay here again for the week that nascar was in town. Right away we found hairs on our beds (we had a two bedroom suite) we asked to have the blankets changed out. The living room had can tabs on the floor, which made it very clear that no one vacuumed. We stayed for 3 nights and four days, they said there was no room service for guests not staying four nights. We had to constantly call for towels, trash bags, and pillows. Then we decided to go to the pool and they said the pool slides were being repaired, my kids were so bummed they were looking forward to that. The incident that took the cake, was the presentation that they offer as a \"gift for you.\" It's to sell you time shares, they called up to see how the room was and if we wanted the gift. A $75 gift card and free three night stay in a hotel of our choice. My husband heard that and wanted to go right away. I didn't want to. My sister was in the next room and she said she wanted to go too. They said my husband had to bring his wife in order to get \"the gift.\" They said it would only take 90 minutes, so along I went we left our older kids upstairs and took our youngest with us.  The man that took us back started off by showing pictures of his daughter and how buying a timeshare had afforded him a life for his daughter that he could not have done prior to buying the time share. We then went into a room with a man that was very funny and did make good points about timeshares but never really broke down the costs individually. He showed the properties that they had and how we could purchase condos in our timeshares. Then we went back to the original guy that showed us the pictures of his daughter. He would ask us questions about what we wanted to leave our children has an inheritance? He said this would be great to leave them. Ummm a time share that is an extra burden to them, not so much. He didn't like that I didn't agree with him. I'm sure my kids would like other things to inherit when I die, a time share is not my form of an inheritance. He then starting bickering with us about how we pay for our vacations. We are very frugal we save and my husband travels and saves points through his work and we purchase our tickets to travel through that program. He said that was impossible, we said it was possible. He asked us how we like to travel, we said usually with family and we visit family. Well those are little vacations. We have big beautiful hotels and condos that we can purchase. He then started breaking down the places we like to go to and asking us how much we spend on vacation. Whenever we would try and anticipate the costs of traveling to a certain place he would chuckle and say that's not possible. I began to get irritated with this guy and my kids were calling me and texting me and I was answering there calls and texting them back. He began to get irritated with me doing this. He would stop the presentation and then say I'm just waiting for you. I would say you're going to continue to wait they're my priority. Finally he got irritated because we weren't answering the questions the way he wanted. He wanted us to pay $416 a month to finance our future vacations. We laughed that was not even a choice for us. The answer was no and that was not something we would want to do. My husband said I wouldn't even pay half of that. He wanted to banter back and forth and we kept telling him to just finish the presentation so we could get the gift. That's the only reason we were there. He then said I can take as much time as I want, you signed something saying it would take up to 120 minutes to be here. My husband said we didn't sign anything, and went to the lady in the front who had got us to come. He said I'm going to get the manager, wait I am the manager you're going to wait. We had already been here for over an hour and a half and my kids had been waiting. To finish this long story we got the gift but it was not worth what that guy put us through. He had someone come get his things because he was too upset to come back. This was not what I expected and I was very annoyed with the way this guy presented this package.",

            "text" : "The good:  The resort offers a lot of amenities.  A very nice pool, very pretty and water was sparkling clean.  Nice area with barbecues if you are so inclined.  Check in is 4 pm but they actually got us in a bit early, about 2:45 which was nice because we had just arrived from So Cal and had a wedding to attend at 4:30.  The suite was spacious.\n\nThe bad:  The bathrooms were not ADA compliant.  Not a problem for my husband and I but my father in law is elderly, very unstable and uses a cane.  No walk-in showers -- tubs with a super high side.  Definitely a fall risk.  Also, there was no hot water on either sink.  Another family member who was staying there with her elderly mother who uses a walker was told that there would be a walk-in shower and there was not so she was unable to bathe.\n\nThe signs on the fence outside the pool area indicate that hours are 8 am to 10 pm.  But when we were there we noticed there were signs placed around the pool indicating that the pool was closed.  Several people including those with children were waiting to use the pool but were told the reason the pool was closed was because there was no lifeguard on duty.  Again, not a problem for us but I can imagine parents with excited pool-bound children would be very unhappy.  Now we were there in February but it was unseasonably warm and sunbathers abounded.\n\nThe Ugly:  The stench in the hallway was so disgusting that we avoided it as much as possible.  Perhaps they had a leak and the carpeting had mildewed.  I don't know what it was but let me just say it was not just an odor but a stomach turning stench.  We were on the second floor but we also noticed it on the first floor, though it was not quite as strong.\n\nThe staff is clearly trying to encourage timeshare purchase so it would seem that these problems would be addressed.  My recommendation -- replace the carpet, don't just try to cover it up with fragrance.  That ship has sailed.  Install handicapped bars in the bathtubs.  A lawsuit would be much more costly.  Not doing so says you don't care about the well-being of your patrons.  While I also understand that maintenance must be done, it was unfortunate that the water slides were not open.  Also, two of the four spas were closed for maintenance.  Not impressive to a potential timeshare purchaser.  And spring for a lifeguard to be on duty from 8 am to 10 pm.  Probably not as costly as unhappy pool-goers.  \n\nBottom line:  This resort has potential, but trying to save a few bucks makes them look bad.  If I had been considering purchasing a timeshare this definitely would have deterred me.  If the resort isn't willing to spend the extra bucks to impress me enough to draw me in, how would they have made sure I was a happy resident once they got my money?  Too bad... I won't be back and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",

Three margaritas and chips - $40+ tip. Needless to say, we only went there once. Go shopping across Las Vegas Blvd and bring back groceries.\n\nOur room faced north and we were able to park outside,  mostly in the shade, four floors directly below our balcony.

Almost all of the strip hotels now charge for parking, so Lyft was our transportation of choice but that adds up also. Much of downtown is still free.\n\nWe were guests of friends who had a Diamond Resorts timeshare. We sat down for one meeting to get the \"special\", but didn't commit to anything.

I say jacuzzis, but these things were like two person hot tubs. They were big and deep. They had three TVs, full kitchen, etc. The balcony was huge and had a nice view of the strip even though we wanted a pool view room. In any case, the beds were queens, but we could have used more pillows. Since we did not notice this until about 4 am, we did not bother them with this request. \n     The pool area is beautiful. Although it was a little chilly when we were there, there are two big pools, one with a few large waterslides that looked really fun. I'm sure this is overrun by small children in the warmer seasons. There are five hot tubs including one underneath a waterfall. This is relaxing, but loud and not conducive to conversation. There are others with hammocks around them and what not. Very nice groups with a huge replica of a Mayan pyramid in the middle. No outside food or drink as I was told by my nervous 18 year old lifeguard, because you have to buy theirs from the cafe and/or bar. We just brought ours down anyway and poured it in cups. Everyone else did too, so stop cryin!\n     The fitness center was more of a closet. Nevertheless, I managed to get a very good workout in with the equipment that they have. You just have to think outside the box a little. The thing that bother me though was that the circuit kept blowing for the treadmills, so we had to keep flipping the switch in the circuit box. This probably happened every five minutes when two of the three treadmills were being used simultaneously. \n     As for the location, it is about five miles from the heart of the strip. Not bad for a short drive. The shuttle stops at 12, which pretty much makes it useless as that is when people need a DD. But if you want to avoid the hassles of strip driving during the day then maybe it is worth it. There is not much around, but there is a 24 hour bar across the street if you came to Vegas for that. Not me, but if you are sick of the strip or don't like people, this might be your spot. There are some food options, a food 4 less, and CVS for your convenience. If you have no car, this place would be pretty difficult as I hear cab fares are expensive to the action.\n     I heard that the timeshare people were pretty annoying, but I didn't see any.

They give you foam noodles and floatable mats for you to lounge on. The pool boy will even give you suggestions on where to party. This pool is so vast you will never bump into anyone even though everyone's got some sort of floatation device. It's a good spot for families to relax.\n\nThe rooms are like little apartments with 2 bathrooms, one master suite, a room with two twin beds, a full kitchen, a dining room, living room with a pull out sofa, and a balcony. They're clean but really dark. This place could use more lamps and brighter light bulbs. The accomodations are pleasant enough.\n\nMy only real complaint is the location of the resort. It's so far off the strip a cab ride will cost you $20 and the free shuttle takes forever!!! What a waste of time and money. Sometimes the shuttle never even came back or showed up. I recommend renting a car to get to the strip if you plan on hanging out over there. BTW, who goes to Vegas to not hang out on the strip? I don't get it. I will say though in the day time, the shuttle driver was very nice. There is a shopping center (grocery store and Starbucks) across the street. The cross walk is inconveniently placed and running across the driving lanes dodging cars going 60mph is a bit like playing Frogger. The shuttle driver was generous enough to go off route and give us a ride across the street. \n\nBest errand run ever. Fill up on bagels, rotisserie chicken, and full size bottles of alk and you are good to go. Remember these rooms come with a full kitchen so make yourself at home before you head out to party (pre party. pre party). Oh there's also a gym here if sweating in the Vegas sun is not enough for you.",

            "text" : "Ok, I probably had one of the most irritating experiences here this past weekend.  All started when I got my room and then they send me to the concierge to get my parking pass.  The dude then tries to make an appointment for me to come to they're \"owners update meeting.\" If I go, then he'll throw out some Vegas shows and freebies at me.  It's the same spiel I get every time and the goodies have all become crap items now. So really, it's not worth me sitting in an hour presentation.  But, I figure if I have time I'll try to come by Sunday \"if possible\".  The dude then makes an appointment for me and gives me something to sign.  I notice at the bottom he writes $20 and I ask him about it.  \n\nConcierge: Oh yes, you're required to pay $20 if I you don't show up.\n\nMe: HELL NO!  You shoulda let me know about that beforehand instead of trying to make me sign it without telling me! \n\nConcierge: I'm sorry sir, don't worry about it, I'll wave the fee.\n\nMe: Yeah, after I just caught you in the act!  If I didn't catch you, I'd be stuck going or have to pay!\n\nHe then rips the paper he wanted me to sign and says, \"God Bless You.\"  Like I'm supposed to feel bad for him trying to swindle me.  Yeah, I caused a scene and I was pissed! I've been an owner with Monarch Grand Vacations for over 5 years now and not once had I experienced such shadyness. That's total bs!!!!  \n\nAlso, during our stay we had to wait over an hour and a half to get more towels.  I was about to go downstairs and get it myself since it'd be much faster.  Because of the delay we were unable to get ready in time for a show we wanted to see and ended up having dinner really late.  Plus, one day during our stay, we took out the Do Not Disturb sign to have our room cleaned and guess what???  It wasn't cleaned! AAARRGGH!!!\n\nTo top it all off, when I checked out of the room I had a stimulating conversation with the lady at the front desk.\n\nFront Desk: So how was your stay, Sir?\nMe: Not so good.\nFront Desk: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nThat was it! WTF??  Why even ask, if you have no care as to why my stay was not so good. It's like they got robots at the counter! They even had a problem with their computers and they couldn't give me a receipt. The lady at the front desk wanted me to have a seat and wait. By that time, I'm fed up with this place and I just tell them to email it to me.(I'm still waiting on that email and will probably never get it!)\n\nI can't believe this.  I've been hyping this place up to my family for months since it's the first time they'd be visiting.  I even told them how they could become owners.  But really, I couldn't justify recommending the place after the horrible experience I had.\n\nI'm sending a letter to management about my experience but I'm afraid it may be handled by deaf ears.  We will see.  I'm still an owner and I like the place. The room is comfortable and the large pool is great. It's the people that need work.  I'll be back again and the service better have improved or I may seriously look into selling my timeshare.",

The shower in the master room was an oversized jacuzzi tub that was very difficult to get in and out.  We almost slipped a couple of times trying to get in.  We had to request a step stool.  The concern of any handicapped person, much less a normal person, trying to get in and out of this tub should be a priority of this resort.  Also, the activities center needs to ensure they are communicating to all guests.  Upon our check in, we were given an activities list by day.  My nieces missed the all the Christmas Day activities because the revised holiday list was not distributed to all guests after the changes had been made nor did they make any calls.

We stayed at Diamond Resorts other property, Polo Towers, last time we were in Vegas.  This time we wanted a hotel a little off the strip but still close enough that we could easily get to it.  Cancun Resort fit that bill.\nThe Good:\nVery nice property.  The rooms are clean and nicely decorated.  Huge pool (we didn't get a chance to use it but I did dangle my feet in while having a drink and it is warmed to 80 degrees which was nice).  The bartenders, especially Caesar, were really nice at the restaurant/cantina.  We ate at the restaurant for dinner once and two times for breakfast, besides being served on plastic plates with plastic forks it was very well prepared and tasty.  \nThe rest of the staff was all very nice, we got free tickets to a comedy show from the concierge desk when we checked it which was really cool.  \nThe OK...(a little bad):\nThe hard sell.  The concierge offered us a $100 room credit to use toward amenities in the hotel if we we did a \"tour\" of the upgrades they are doing to this property since DR just acquired it in September.  It was only supposed to be a 90 min tour according to them so we were like for $100, sure!  Well, when we got there it was the hard sell for the time share and it was going to take over two hours!  I had already told the concierge that my parents have bought a lot of points on purpose so that my sister and I could use them anytime we wanted so I was defiantly NOT interested in buying.  When we got to the tour thing I told the same thing to the sales lady and she was basically like \"WTH?  Why are you here wasting my time?\".  She was super nice and and this is her job so I felt really, really bad.  We ended up leaving and put the things we had charged to the room on a credit card instead.  If we would have known that in advance we would a have A) never agreed to go and B) ate outside of the hotel to experience other food that was probably less expensive.  I felt really bad about being mislead into believing it was just a tour.\nOver all it was a good experience however and a learning experience as well.  I would stay at Cancun again.",

Being time share owners we took advantage of the Getaways offered by interval international and chose Cancun by Diamond Resorts for our seven day vacation. Check in was easy as we came in December 17 in the evening. I started to get really suspicious when the front counter pointed us to th VIP reception and the lady there pushed us to accept their welcome packet. When I questioned her weather this was another time share presentation she replied that it was just a way for the hotel to welcome their visitors. She offered a buffet ticket for four at the Stratosphere(more on that later) and a $25 Visa card. That on the condition that they hold $40 on our credit card as a deposit. THAT IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY FOR A TIME SHARE PRESENTATION SNARE SO BEWARE!\n\nThe room we chose was their smallest units. The kitchen was a little cramped as the refrigerator took a better part of the counter, but it was a full sized ref. They also had a full size gas stove, coffee maker and blender. Can't complain on that one since we would rather prepare our food than put up with over priced and unhealthy meals outside, and we did use the kitchen. The unit had one bedroom but it had two bathrooms. The sofa bed had good mattress support that gave us a good night sleep. The room also had two flat screen TVS (40\" probably, Samsung brand) and a dining table for four. The bathrooms were clean and the whole unit was simply spic and span. As far as the room was we were completely satisfied. The only thing that did not work were their kitchen knives as they were extremely dull. If you regularly use time share properties you know what I mean, which is why we always bring our own kitchen knives.\n\nIt was when we went to pick up our welcome packet two days later that the experience hit a sour note. We found ourselves herded into this large parlor along with at least 40 people that we finally figured out what we were in for. That's right, it was a marathon time share presentation that lasted three whopping hours! I was hoping that they would cut it short for the sake of our five year old daughter, but no. By the time the whole affair concluded we all had dry eyes, my back was aching and we were all starving. The presenter was so busy talking about himself that he did not bother to ask us if we wanted to purchase. We already have two time shares and no longer needed any. That could have saved us 1.5 hours and could have earned Cancun 1.5 stars in this review.\n\nAt the end the only good thing was when we finally went to pick up our gifts and free our captive $40 they ran out of stratosphere buffet tickets each valued at $13 (as paid by the time share company to another time share company), and instead offered us three $25 coupon to the Top of the World restaurant along with the $25 visa gift card. There is another issue with these coupons that they issued but I will cover that on my review of Top Of The World restaurant.\n\nIf you are a time share owner (not Diamond Resort) and are going to use Cancun for your vacation, fight tooth and nail to reject their \"free\" gift offers or \"welcome\" offers. You will save yourself a whole half a day of grief unless you get a kick out of time share presentations.",

Wanting to do something special I called three days ahead to work something out with the hotel. \n\nI didn't expect them to come up with a surprise for my husband, I simply wanted to know if they recommended companies or if there was a particular way I should handle what I had planned (simple cake and balloons). \n\nAfter speaking to the hotel manger, Vivian,  I was directed to speak to concierge. She assured me that if I had a cake and balloons delivered concierge would work with me to have them in his room when he checked in. I was connected to concierge - in a city \"that doesn't sleep\" at 12:55pm I was listening to a voice recording telling me to pick one of three concierges to leave a message for. I simply picked the first person whose name I heard, Terri. After not hearing back for 24 hours, I called back to speak to the manager, only to find out, Terri no longer worked for the company - are you serious!!! and transferred me to another concierge attendant. Again, I left a voicemail. I don't know about you, but concierge's job is to serve the hotel customer, to provide stellar customer service, and having to leave a message is ridiculous! I finally received a call back from a gentlemen in concierge who rudely told me they not only couldn't do anything, they wouldn't do anything. I re-explained that I simply wanted to have balloons and a cake delivered and was told by the hotel manager that concierge could help me get them into his room before he checked in at 7pm. Again, I was rudely told the manager was very wrong and they don't do that and wouldn't do that. \n\nBeyond frustrated I explained, if I had balloons and a cake delivered, after he'd checked in, how could I get them to him - leave at front desk, call him, etc. the gentlemen in concierge told me I was on my own. That even if I had them delivered to the front desk they would not contact my husband to tell him he had something waiting at the front desk. Are you kidding me?!!!\n\nThree days later, the day my husband checked in, I called the front desk. The ONLY SHINING STAR at this ridiculous place was Dave. He was so kind and explained that the Mrs.Fields package I had ordered and sent to the hotel would be delivered to the front desk at which point they would notify my husband he had a package.\n\nAGAIN they dropped the ball! At the end of the day my husband still had not received the package so I spoiled the surprise and told him. He called the front desk and was told he had no packages. After assuring them he did, two people put him on hold to go look for it. When he arrived at the front desk to pick it up not only was the box too large to \"miss-place\" it had only been delivered in the last hour or two. He questioned why he was not notified of receiving a package that his name was all over, to which he was told - \"we don't always do that, the person sending it should've notified you so you would come ask for it\".\n\nBEYOND horrible service! Even my husband said his interaction with the staff throughout his stay was less than decent. Turns out this place is a time-share too, ha! Don't waste your money or your time!

When you check in, you are told to go over to the concierge for your \"free gifts\" (coupons to local restaurants for buy one, get one free--they're not the greatest restaurants but if you're lazy and out of ideas, maybe try them). The worst part comes next--they try to sell you a timeshare by making you feel like an idiot: \"Oh, it looks like you paid for your hotel stay.\" (you begin to think, wait, others don't?) Then: \"well, you can have a free stay on us next.\" Here's how it works--you pay a deposit of $149, then they refund you the money when you stay the next time (apparently). But you are essentially signing up for a timeshare for a long period, and locked in. What was obnoxious though, after saying we were not interested, was the hard sell. Us: \"we've had a really long day of travel, so we'd like to go and rest now.\" \"Them: Oh, you can go, but at least listen to what I have to say. Don't walk away!\" Then the very worst: at 10am on Sat morning (the next day), we get a call from the concierge with the same hard sell, and multiple questions: who did you speak to? Did they tell you you could have a complimentary stay next time? etc etc\n\nHere's the thing: all I wanted was free wifi. I think that's pretty standard and not too much to ask for in a metropolitan city. However, we were charged the resort fee, on top of the cost of your stay (watch out for this extra fee!) and then charged wifi ($10 extra per day). Then we were promptly told the main pools would be closed for the REST OF THE WEEK. Um, so why did I just pay for the resort fee? What does the resort fee cover, if not basic amenities like wifi and use of the pools? \n\nOh, and the decor looks like it last got updated in the 70s, there are scuff marks all over the doors, walls and furniture. It's so sad I didn't want to relax there after a long day out.",

The rooms are fully equipped with living room, dining room, and full kitchen. No, there aren't many food options, no, it's not anywhere near the strip, no, you can't go downstairs to gamble or bar hop.But if you have a vehicle, you can get to anything pretty quickly since the freeway is close anyway. My sons love the water slides, I love the hammocks. We try to go during the week, and stay in the penthouse, and we never want to leave! I highly, highly suggest for people wanting a \"family\" vacation to stay here! To respond to some of the fomer complaints, yes, we have often had problems with the jacuzzi on the decks, but I pay quarterly maintenance fees, so I don't mind bugging the crap out of the staff to have it fixed.

On the plus side, there is a starbucks within walking distance haha. I spent around $20 one way on taxi service each time I went to my conference site on strip. \n\nOn site at this resort you will find two pools (only one was in service during our visit), a spa (no nail service here), and a work out room that has a good amount of pretty updated equipment. A major downside for me as someone who was on a work trip was the wifi. The wifi did not work the entire time I was at the resort. I called the front desk and was told to contact AT&T directly- apparently that is their provider. That got me nowhere. In addition, I couldn't even plug in because there are no ethernet outlets in the spaces. Soooo free wifi here was useless. One of the pools has a cool slide, and overall the resort seems really family friendly. Final verdict is this is a good place to stay if you have kiddos, but if you plan on being on strip often, just stay on strip.",

We noticed immediately upon arrival that the hallway of the building we were in smelled like mildew. The kitchen in the villa was TINY. Barely fits one person in there, and it's difficult to cook or prepare food because of the lack of counter space. You can't even get to the cabinets next to the refrigerator, and I'm 5'8 with fairly lengthy arms! The sink in the kitchen leaked, the dishwasher top rack was broken, and the garbage disposal backed up into the master bathroom tub! We were on the first floor in the Tulum Building, and we arrived on a Friday night. Saturday and Sunday we wanted to rest, but the Cove Pool with the waterslides opens early on the weekends and we had to contend with the screaming of kids going down the waterslides. Not that much of an issue, really, but we found out later that the pool with the waterslides doesn't even open until mid-afternoon during the week, which wrecked our plans for using it, since we typically left the resort after lunch to sightsee and do other things around town. Also, the front desk needs to get their communication straight. We were told when we checked in that our maid service would be on Monday. When we called on Monday to find out why they hadn't come, they told us that we were slated for Tuesday. Okay, we were initially told Monday, which seemed strange to us since we had just checked in the previous Friday and wouldn't be checking out until the following Sunday. Odd. And when we called to ask about the Cove Pool hours, the front desk told us that it should already be open (at 11:00 a.m.) and then we were transferred to someone else who told us it wouldn't be open until 2:30 p.m. Communication, people! We didn't have an issue with the concierge or the owner's meeting as many of the other reviewers did, but the breakfast that they served us that morning was a joke. I couldn't even get two cups of coffee - they ran out! The eggs tasted like they were powdered, the bacon wasn't good, the sausage was okay, but the breakfast potatoes were awful! In general, it was a fairly comfortable stay - the beds were fine and the rest of the condo was nice, but it is badly in need of overhauling and the tiny kitchens just do not work for people staying more than a week! We stayed for nine days and we couldn't wait to get back home to our modest-sized apartment kitchen because it was bigger than the one we had in the condo! We are used to a LOT better, Diamond.

            "text" : "I don't know why this resort gets so many mixed reviews, I guess most people are just too picky and sweat the small stuff, but I LOVED my stay here this past weekend.  We came with friends and reserved 2 rooms.  When we checked in at 3, we asked for rooms beside eachother, and they accomodated our request with no problem and the girl at the front desk (her name was Quinn) was very informative with how the resort runs (housekeeping, pool hours, etc), and even called the second day to make sure we had everything we needed and that we were happy with everything.  There were no surprises.\n\nThe place was very nice, and very clean, we stayed in building 3 which I believe is from the newer development.  The jacuzzi bath tub was awesome, and I loved the dishwasher since we brought a lot of our own food to cook, making clean up a breeze!  One thing that was a little dissappointing was that the pans were small for cooking for a large group, and they were not non-stick which made cooking and cleanup more difficult, but no big deal, we know to bring our own pans next time!  The food 4 less right across the street also made it convenient to restock on the food items and alcohol we needed.\n\nWe loved the pool area, there were a lot of chairs to lay out, and relaxing hammocks and several jacuzzi areas in addition to the adult only jacuzzi underneath the waterfall.  I wish there were more hammocks though, there are only 5 and they get nabbed up really quick, so you have to get there super early.  The bathrooms beneath the pyramid were very clean too, and easily accessible.\n\nOne thing that isn't particularly bad, just was a little annoying for our group in particular, were that the lifeguards were really strict on swimming attire for us adults in the slide area. I can understand being strict for kids, but my friend was asked to remove her necklace, and they wouldn't let my fiance go down the slide or swim in the pool because they thought the material of his swim trunks didn't look suitable, even though it was made of polyester which is in most swimsuits, it just lacked the more recognizable nylon and lycra materials.  That was irritating being as though we weren't going to buy a whole new pair of swim trunks just for this resort!  But I do understand their concern for cotton materials clogging their filters.\n\nI loved that the resort was far enough from the resort to be quiet and relaxing, but close enough to still enjoy the craziness when you wanted to.  The shuttle service to the strip was great, we called down to the concierge and asked the shuttle times, and right as we stepped out of the front enterance to the curb at that time, the shuttle pulled up as scheduled.  The drop off point at the Tropicana was also very convenient for us.  The last shuttle back to the resort was only at 12:15am though, so it would have been nice if it went to at least 1am or 2am...but the cab ride back to the resort (straight down Las Vegas Blvd from Luxor) was only $15, so it wasn't too big a deal!\n\nOver all, this place was extremely relaxing and I wish we would have been able to stay longer!  Next time we are getting the penthouse for sure, that private jacuzzi on the patio sounds very nice! :)",

In our room, we could barely stay connected to get email.  Forget streaming anything or watching any Facebook or YouTube videos.  We were told that when the internet was put in a long time ago, they set it up for laptops, and that tablets have too small an antenna to get good service.  That didn't help the four of us, who only brought tablets.\nThe deferred maintenance was a real problem.  Two outlets in the kitchen didn't work; the light outside on our balcony buzzed and needed changing.  When we called it in, the ballast still wasn't changed after two days.  The shower was a very strange design in the penthouse (apparently not in the other rooms.) In our room, it was open, w/o a shower curtain, and kept getting water all over the bathroom.  The holes in the shower head were full of calcification, so the water pressure was a problem.  \nThe staff in the lounge didn't seem happy to be there - one complained that they weren't paid much and only got a 20% discount on the food, so they hadn't tried any of it, and couldn't make recommendations.  Another served food to the table while on her cell phone.  \nWe stayed there a week.  When they came in to clean, they didn't clean the bathroom at all until someone came in to check how the cleaning crew was.  One of the burners on the stove didn't work, and we weren't provided with a full set of utensils until we called and asked.  \n\nThe good news:  The view was stunning!  The place was spacious in the penthouse, with a jacuzzi on the balcony and in both bathrooms.  The entire customer service staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and very apologetic when we complained or requested something that should have been done better.  Most of the time, when we requested something from housekeeping (more dish soap, more hangers, more towels, more blankets, etc.) we would receive a call a while later to make sure we got what we wanted.  A very nice touch! \n The food was pretty good for bar food.  When we told them about \"the bad news\", above, the front desk manager comped us a free meal there.  After our rooms were cleaned, the housekeeping manager came over to check to see if things were done right.  When we pointed out that they weren't, they apologized and immediately sent someone over to do it right.  We liked the full kitchen; the garbage disposal worked well, as did the appliances, except for the one burner.  \nThe beds were VERY comfortable!

So awesome!!\nThis time we bought all of our groceries and the girls are super excited to make our dinners!! Not to mention the pool...water slides, waterfalls & hot tubs oh my!!! Lol....large pools....tons of seating around pool, hot tubs all around pool and even under the waterfall (adult only hottub!!! Me likey). It's quiet compared to other hotels right on strip, no casino, so if you have kids and/or a gambling problem, no worries!! You don't have to fly through the floor with kids in tow!! Some casinos won't even allow your child to watch all those flashing lights...lol....that's like trying to keep a starving dog from eating the steak on the floor!!! Anyway, when we got here, we were greeted very nicely and taken care of as soon as possible!! It made my road trip so much more worth it!! (You try listening to \"how many more spongebob episodes now, daddy!!\" For 4 1/2 hours)...LMAO!!\nSeriously best opening vacay Ever!!",

I'm not as concerned about the wi-fi (we're on vacation, dang it) but trying to take a shower after having been in the pool is not pleasant with cold water.\n\nThe one-bedroom villa was absolutely spectacular.  Full kitchen with stove, oven, fridge, microwave, toaster, blender, dishwasher, pots/pans, dishes, glasses, silverware, etc etc made for a very convenient stay.  We were able to pick up groceries and have fresher, healthier meals/snacks.  It was super nice.\n\nHaving a full two bathrooms was a bonus.  The master bathroom was huge with a giant whirlpool tub.  Only complaint is that the whirlpool tub was excessively loud and you could not use it after hours.\n\nGrounds are absolutely gorgeous.  The pools (yes, plural) were very nice, very large, right temperature.  The seating was plentiful, but also spaced apart enough to feel like we weren't crowded.\n\nOverall a great stay, and we'll certainly check Groupon again for a good deal!",

            "text" : "I got a great deal on a one night stay here with my mother.  All I could think about this place is that it would be perfect for a big family.  We got a two room suite that had a fold out futon bed in one room and a large bed in the other.  The room came with a patio and a view of the pool area.  I found the pool area to be the most attractive feature of the resort but they also had a game room and they stocked your personal rooms with dishes and things you would need to make any kind of food you could want.  This definitely seemed like an extended stay type of place but I only stayed one night.  The bathroom was also very nice.  I did find that the bedroom was a lot more attractive than the room with the futon but the suite we had came with a dining table, a large patio, and two bathrooms and I could see that being a deal-maker with some large groups.\n\nCheck-in took a while and the guy behind the counter was a little impatient because they were supposedly busy (but there really weren't that many people checking in so I wasn't sure why there was stress).  There was also a concierge desk that basically existed to try and get you to spend more money and book more stays before you had even spent a moment outside of the lobby.  I always find that annoying.  If a place is good it can sell itself and you don't need salesmen there to try and pitch it.  That whole situation was off-putting.\n\nBut all the rooms were nice and the pool area was great!\n\nI'm giving this place a four because of the concierge pitch and the general overbearingness of that situation.  How can anyone enjoy their stay if it takes more than a half hour to get to their room?  It should never take more than a half hour to get to your room.\n\nAll that being said, the room was very affordable and I would stay there again in a heartbeat if given the same deal.\n\nIf choosing between this place and the Green Valley Ranch, I would definitely choose the Green Valley Ranch.  The rooms were nicer in the Green Valley Ranch and it took less than ten minutes to check in.  Also, Green Valley Ranch has a casino inside and stores attached to the property and a movie theater.  I think the big difference is that the Green Valley Ranch is more of a hotel and Cancun Resort is more of a condo.  You stay at Cancun if you want to cook elaborate meals and spend all day at the pool.  \n\nCancun was lacking in a few areas when compared to similar resorts in Vegas like Green Valley Ranch and South Point.",

There's a kitchen with full-sized fridge, stove, microwave and even a dishwasher; it's also equipped with pots, pans, dishes and silverware. We didn't use any of that, but it's there. Add the dining area to that, and it's a nice public area to host friends. \n\nThe bedroom has a king-sized bed and a bathroom larger than some hotel rooms I've stayed in, and has a jetted tub and two sinks. There are large televisions in both the bedroom and living area, equipped with DVD and blu-ray players. \n\nThe pool area is extensive, with a large pool, several hot tubs, and four water slides and a waterfall that pour out of an Aztec-styled temple. There are plenty of pool chairs and a small bar and bistro in the pool area, and even with the area packed, it never felt crowded.\n\nWith all those positive things about the Cancun, you do need to be aware that it's really a time share resort, part of the Diamond Resorts chain.

First of all, they are no longer Monarch Resorts, they are Diamond Resorts (which they were very vague about this transition). We got there on a Friday around 12pm. They took us to the \"VIP\" check-in. The lady was really, really nice but I get the feeling the employees no longer have a clue what the hell is going on with this new ownership. Our check-in was supposed to be at 1pm so she said since we were early that she would go ahead and get us into a room right away. \"A room with a nice view and a better room than the one that was reserved.\" We were like, \"Woooow well thank you, we really are VIP.\" Pfff! We go up to the room and the following happened:\n As soon as we stepped out of the elevator, we noticed it was HOT and muggy. And *crickets*. I mean it's good that a place isn't packed but we thought it was odd that it was super quiet...ghost town. We go into the room and the place is a mess!! And I kid you not, looked like it was being used as storage (which I know realize it probably was). So we call right away and they tell us to come down to the front desk. coming to find out, that whole building was empty bc it was going through \"renovations?\" And guess what? The people that has reservations in that building were sent to other rooms...and guess what? Our room was taken by someone else! So we waited for over an hour to get a room. So for our \"troubles\" they give us 3 complimentary breakfasts for the 3 adults (as in, the 2 kids in your party don't get jack squat). So whatever, we go down to breakfast the next day and again we notice it's like ghost town. We go to the cafe on the voucher and it's closed! So we go to the building that has the bar and we go in there and after waiting for him (only guy working there) to get off the phone he says we can order breakfast there. Which I will say, was good. We end up paying $30 for drinks and the 2 extra breakfasts for the kids. Monday morning we have a meeting. This meeting consisted of them trying to convince us to buy directly from Diamond Resorts BUT you must continue to pay your Monarch Resort payment. Yes...2 payments. Well, at least we will use other Diamond Resort places but they def need to work on Cancun. It's such a beautiful place with horrible service! \n\nExtra star is for the convenience of the rooms (2 rooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen/dining room, living room, tv in each room, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, pots/pan, plates, cups, utensils).\n \nPS- No more shuttle, pools were closed the whole time expect for one small area.",

I haven't played a round of golf in a few months, so playing a par 3 course was a nice way to sharpen my iron game.  Not having to hit driver on almost every hole really helps to conserve energy and help fight that heat exhaustion. \n\nThe golf carts come with a cooler.  The course was nice enough to provide 2 bottles of water and ice in the cooler.  This is pretty standard for a Vegas course, but nonetheless the gesture is always appreciated.  \n\nThe course is nice.  The fairways and greens are well manicured.  Errant shots off of the fairways and greens will not hurt much since the rough isn't very long.   The views are spectacular.  You have a good view of the mountains, picturesque holes with a pond, and an awesome view of the strip.  \n\nOur tee time was at 12:02, but when i checked in a little after 11, I was told I could go out whenever I was ready.  Given that this is an executive course and a hot summer day, there weren't too many people on the course.  There was no one in front of behind us to rush us at all.  We even took a 20 minute break at the turn to cool off.  Since there was no one on the course, we got to take a few mulligans without having to look over our shoulders and holding up traffic behind us.  We played at a very leisurely pace and had a lot of fun.  The holes are set up fairly and play nicely.  This is a great course to get a lot of practice and build some confidence.  Golf is not fun when you shoot a bad score and greens break 3 ways to tomorrow.  Play here and you'll have fun, not feel hurried, and be able to shoot a nice score.",

            "text" : "Additional thoughts as of 05/14/2016:\n\nThere is something that occurred to me as a potential to marketing.  I do not know how this could be monetized and encourage more sales within the store, but this will help with market differentiation.  \n\nIf you wish to cater to a broader group of people, not just Asians, you should setup a working kitchen demonstration area.  You then could have appropriate various people give cooking demonstrations using the products in store.  You could make the recipes available on flyers (English, Spanish, etc), and also indicate which aisles have the products.  Keep it short and simple.  Present it in a manner that grabs attention.  This is a way to increase marketing, and perhaps increase sales.  This would be a market differentiator.  Focus more on the fusion of culture.  Let the presenters innovate and present different things that are a mix of different cultures in the same dish.  Obviously, make sure it looks good.  This is my thought.  The presenters can be Asian, Mexican, whatever, as long as:\n\n1) The budget is appropriate (people are cost conscious)\n2) It is not complicated, and must be easy (people want simple)\n3) It is not time consuming (people do not want to spend excessive time)\n4) Products are available in store (delivery....people want to purchase it today).\n5) It is healthy (people are health conscious)\n\nSpend less time trying to be \"WALMART\", and more time differentiating yourself.  \n\n---------------------\nThis place, while big, is totally in need of work.  Here are my exact thoughts:\n\n1) There is no rhyme or reason to the way the store is laid out.  Nothing flows.  It is a total zoo on the shopping floor.  Get an Industrial Engineering consultant to help you with the floor layout!!!  It will be better then!!!!\n\n2) This appears to be more of a market catering to those of Latino origin with Asian overtones.  I do not see it otherwise.  \n\n3) There were many so-called \"Asian\" goods that were \"missing\" from the shelves.  There are much more varieties and available products elsewhere at other Asian markets nearby.  \n\n4)  The owners of this store are the same as those that run The Mekong Marketplace just around the corner and up the road on Dobson.  If their intention was to keep both of them open, I do not see that.  One of the two (either this one or the Mekong) is going to close down ultimately.  Each of these will cannibalize the customers from the other.  It may end up that one or the other survives, or none survive.  \n\nI have unfortunately seen this scenario here in the USA (not in Arizona).  One only needs to look at Nashville TN and the business of K&S Markets.  K&S Market had two locations.  One in East Nashville on Nolensville Pike, and one in South Nashville.  The East Nashville location was the older of the two markets.  What happened was the South Nashville location was open for a few years, and then closed for a lack of business.  People just reverted back to the noise and chaos of the East Nashville (the original) location, after seeing the disappointment and lack of products at the new location.\n\nI see either The Mekong closing, or this place closing, after a few years.  If I gambled, and I do not gamble, I am going to say that The Mekong will whether the storm, and this place will probably close.  Sorry, but this is my thought.\n\nThe only way I would see the AZ International Marketplace stay open is by market distinction and doing something different then what The Mekong does.  Right now, it appears this is an \"inferior\" product compared to The Mekong.",

I got a Wintermelon Green Tea with boba and really enjoyed it, very reminiscent to Gong Cha's except really on the sweet side. I would suggest ordering half sweet here at iSnow (from what I recall). The boba itself was very good, perfectly cooked, soft but chewy and tasted like brown sugar. Price was also very reasonable. Flavors remind me more of the legit milk tea/teas I'm used to and fond of. They also serve shaved ice and ice cream here as well.\n\nParking is easy here as the plaza it's located in is large with not many store fronts to compete with.

The Noodle selection, stocks, vinegars and base sauces. i came here last week and liked it, Didnt buy a lot, I just purchased the products to make Soba noodle soup. Noodles, pork belly, mushrooms, green onions, mire poix, the things to make a broth, It was delicious. This was of course after the large publicity about this market's grand opening just over a week before. \n\ni cook professionally, recreationally, and passionately. Nothing impacts my life more than the love of food. So nothing excites me more then more options in my area. i grew up on the ocean, with fresh fish. I work in Arizona restaurants that bring in fresh fish daily. It truly is good product. Coming from the coast, I think it is truly an amazing thing to be able to have good seafood in the hot desert. \n\nUnfortunately today, I literally felt my passion take a hit, not enough to stop me. What it did do though is make me lose faith in thinking that this city actually has a good enough food scene to support the Chef that I am becoming. The restaurant scene is great, but the market scene isnt the best. I was ready to go here and shop today. i was going to create a restaurant quality dish at home. I had brainstormed and only one thing was uncertain, what would I be able to work with that I could truly feel the love while cooking it. I just assumed i was coming to this place and they would have something good, other than the noodle soup i made last week. \n\nThe fish on ice selection isnt bustling with top fishes that i'd want to cook. A couple options were decent, if it was fresh. The smell is way too fishy. i wouldnt serve it. If its not perfect, you should throw it out. The problem is that companies dont want to do that. i am pretty sure that some of that fish was way past \"fresh\" There was also crab and crawfish just sitting out nowhere near ice with flies lingering around it. This isnt as big of a deal to some people as it is to me, but that is because of my passion for food and lifestyle.\n\nThat is why we cant have a better food scene. There is only passion in the restaurant aspect of it, there needs to be passion throughout the city. \n\nThis city needs at least one store, (not AJ's, or Albertsons) that can truly satisfy the need for an international market, that has a lot of options. With food that is fresh, and standards that are high.",

Originally, I was pointed to this store when I wanted to make sushi and was looking for the specific ingredients. Not only did I find everything (including the dishes & cooking supplies) for a decent price, but I ended up having to go back just to check out the rest of the store & variety of products, because the store is HUGE and they have just about everything! \n\nThe store is pretty well organized. There is a section for each country/cuisine. Literally every department of the store is HUGE, so there is no problem finding a variety & selection! Which made me absolutely love their FRESH meat department. Along with fresh, live seafood, they have such a variety of fresh meats, pre-seasoned, raw or ready to heat & eat. Their produce, some of it was a little weak, and I don't have a whole lot to say on the dairy department because there was not a whole lot to that area (cream cheese is pretty basic but was difficult to barely find) but they also have such a good variety of things you normally don't find at the regular supermarkets that it is totally worth sorting through. I was a little disappointed that one thing I absolutely could not find was smoked salmon... the only thing they had \"close\" to that was smoked mackerel in a very unappealing package of the entire fish, head & all. They definitely have fresh, RAW salmon, or any other fish you could want. \n\nIn fact, they pretty much have everything when it comes to a variety of all sorts of cuisine culture. Loved finding fresh octopus, lumpia & my favorite basmati rice. Their prices are really decent when it comes to most items, and checkout was pleasantly quick. I even found some home-goods walking past that section for a steal. The store is so big you could easily get lost or spend hours browsing the HUGE selection... but it is well worth it. And it won't break the bank with the competitive prices comparing it to other local supermarkets where you won't find the variety, specialty items or huge selection of fresh meats. I shop here for many reasons, and recommend this place to anyone who loves international cuisine & cooking!",

This has always been a plus because you have so many different types of food to choose from. I do think that a lot of the food has been sitting on the shelves for A LONG TIME because of the sheer amount they have compared to the amount of customers they get per day. The store is never really busy. This always makes me feel like the foods I buy aren't as fresh as they should be.\n\nThey use to have a very large chip/snack aisle that has disappeared in the past couple of months. Now I can barely find any of the Chinese chip options when they use to have a huge aisle that always had to be restocked because it was popular. \n\nOverall, this place has nice options and so many different types of foods, drinks, spices, and more.

We lucked out and got a spot in the marketplace parking lot but I saw other cars parking along the side streets and others circling around and around for an open spot. \n\nThe festival is in an enclosed part of the parking lot but they had a good number of food trucks and booths. I also saw a climbing wall and a stage off to the side where they had someone singing when I was there. There was a sectioned off area with a good amount of seating for enjoying your food truck meal. There were a ton of people walking around so if you don't like hanging out in large crowds this isn't your place.\n\nSome of the vendors I saw were The Lemongrass Shack, Flippin' Rice, Pho King, Happy Honu Shaved Ice, The Luau Hut, Fiiz Sodas, Beignet Babes, Later Tater, and Curbside Crepes. \n\nTheir Facebook page noted that there wouldn't be any mooncakes for sale at the festival (Although they were available at the market if you wanted a box). Since it was advertised as a Lunar Festival it would have been nice to have a booth for people to purchase them. Maybe next year!\n\nI loved how this was a dog friendly event too and there were so many cute pups walking around with their humans. \n\nI think it's great that AZ Marketplace hosted this event and there was so much representation of Asian food here. They seem to hold these food truck festivals here every few months so if you missed the Lunar festival one keep an eye out for another in the future.",

Well, it's a bit better than that. And it's also a bit worse. Grand Opening was IMO complete chaos!! It's in a huge mall just east of the Dobson/Broadway intersection and the store itself faces Broadway. There are all sorts of businesses in this mall like Family Dollar, Koreatown and some other eateries that I couldn't tell if they were really open or not but this supermarket will definitely be the anchor. The Grand Opening was delayed because they needed more time and looks like it will be some time before the place is fully up and running. None of the internal businesses within International Marketplace seemed to be open yet. While I probably didn't make it along every possible pathway due to crowds and craziness I did notice a few things that caught my eye - they had a Burmese section - I don't remember seeing anything like that in Lee Lee's or Mekong or Asiana or any other Asian market in town. I winded up getting a bag of crunchy roasted lablab beans (Shwe Kyet) for novelty and curiosity's sake - ended up being a good beer snack. Unfortunately when I stood in line to pay for my haul that little bag didn't have a price tag and the girl who went looking for it took an eternity to find it. I'm sure the folks in line behind me were annoyed considering every line that day was a mile long. Just about the time I was about to tell the cashier to \"forget it\" so we could all just go home the girl came back with the price. This place could use better signs and considering how big it is it could definitely use a map with a \"hey dummy - you are right HERE!!\" red arrow in various parts of the store. One cool thing they had on Sunday was a wandering Mexican band playing music. The speakers were also blasting some kind of tribute to Prince so every so often you'd get a little combination of both. It would've actually been really cool if the Mexican band actually played Prince songs in Spanish with the trumpets standing in for the synth lines - that would have rocked my world like it was 1999.",

The different ethnic sections are more organized and the Feng Shui flow of the store is starting to take shape.\n\nUsually come here for Asian ingredients but this store has so much more. The place is basically split into two sections with the produce and fresh meat / fish sections positioned in the center. The Mexican / American side has all the items you need to make your favorite Mexican recipes as well as the typical American items that you would get at a regular grocery store.\n\nThe Asian side is packed with everything you need to create any type of authentic Eastern dish. All you need is a recipe and a good list of ingredient and you are ready to go. Not to mention some good appetites.\n\nStopped here last time to get stuff to make Vietnamese Lemongrass Street Tacos. This is a great fusion recipe that we found in the local AZ Republic newspaper and it has become a big hit at our house (see link). Tangy marinated Pork with a garlicky fish sauce cooked with lemongrass and topped with pickled cucumbers, carrots and all sorts of other goodies.\n\nhttp://www.azcentral.com/story/life/food/recipes/2014/09/09/vietnamese-street-tacos-recipe/15300555/\n\nWhat is nice about this store is that you can get everything you need without having to make multiple stops.

They have a couple different smaller restaurants inside if you decided you need to refuel before shopping. There are also bigger restaurants in the parking lot that you can enjoy as well. It's kinda like going on a vacation to a foreign land and not having to deal with the airport hassles.\n\nSee you there next time when we are trying out a new recipe at the house.

When my wife and I walked in the first thing you notice is that unmistakable smell of raw fish and something cooking.  It seems that almost all of the markets of this type have that aroma.  It's not bad but you definitely will not forget it when you smell it for the first time.  As we walked in I noticed that this place has a couple of eateries inside.  It wasn't lunch time or anything so they were not busy at all.  Something else that I noticed, comparing to the other markets, is the spacious aisles.  The aisles are wide enough that two carts can pass each other with relative comfort.  The floor was clean as was just about everything else in this store.  The produce section was amazing with a large variety of fresh fruit and veggies.  In the back of the store they have a meat department as well as another meat counter where you can purchase fresh Mexican cheeses, ceviche and different things.  As far as selection of canned goods and different varieties of food from different countries, they compare to both Mekong and Lee Lee's.\nThe ONLY complaint I have about this place is their selection of fresh fish and meat is a lot smaller than both of the other markets and they don't have the live tanks.  My solution: Go to AZIM for the produce and everything else then go a couple of blocks over to Mekong and get the live fish if you want it",

The beer was still good. \n\nUnfortunately, the patronage left much to be desired. We initially sat at the bar. The big guy two seats over was loudly discussing his personal information with lots of graphic details and use of the eff bomb every three or four words. After about five minutes or so of this, we decided to move to another part of the bar. I know it's a bar and after a night of drinking, conversation flows, and it's not always nice. \n\nAs we passed a large drunk man sitting alone at the end of the bar, he confronted my bf about \"walking by without speaking.\". Look. We are from Kansas and this is the second time we have been here ever. Why would we speak to this man?  My bf smiled and indicated we were just there to eat. The man then confronted ME and demanded to know if I was a girlfriend or a wife. When we moved a second time to escape, this goon followed us and put his hands on my bf. I thought it was all over. My bf minds his own business, but he does not take kindly to confrontational people. The bouncer was about six feet away, but apparently this dude is a regular, so he was allowed to harass us. Bouncer did eventually call a cab, but until it arrived, this man was allowed to teeter around the bar touching people and getting into their business. \n\nI have no desire to return to The Dubliner after this experience. It could be a cool place, but a couple of seedy characters and the staff's inattention to their incredibly offensive behavior have spoiled it for me.",

With a sigh, she said yes, we ordered two pints of Guinness, one Jameson and the fried pickles. 10 minutes later, we had nothing in front of us. I appreciate when a bar takes the proper time with guinness, but this was ridiculous. \n\nUsually the last few minutes before happy hour ends, the bartenders do a great job of making the rounds to make sure everyone is taken care of. Not the case at The Dubliner this night. No staff to be found anywhere. Although I could see our two pints of Guinness sitting there on the other side of the bar. Finished. Ready.  Wanting to be delivered. And when I asked the only staff in sight, she said oh yeah they're going to grab them now, I saw someone grab them, move them about two inches to the right and set them back down. Then everyone vanished again for about 4-5 more minutes. \n\nIt wasn't just is, it was everyone at the bar who was sharing the feeling of being ignored. \n\nFinally, someone grabbed the pints and delivered then with the Jameson and dropped the fried pickles off soon after. Just in time, too, as we were just about to walk. \n\nWish we had. The pickles were NOTHING like our previous visit, they were barely cooked and swimming in a pool of oil. Inedible. We mentioned it to the bartender, who didn't offer any apologies, all she said was that you never know what you're gonna get, it depends on who is working the fryer that night. Wow. \n\nWith that, we gulped our drinks, paid the tab, and left.

First and foremost,  there is always a mob of people sitting outside the front door smoking.  There is no way to circumvent the raunchy cloud of toxins.  I wish they would move the smoking area a few feet further from the door (maybe in the back/side parking area, hint, hint).  Also, on Friday and Saturday nights there are not enough servers here.

Anyway. most of the tapas were nice and the prices were reasonable, with the exception of the beef tartare which on the night we had it, had an off flavour related to the spices. The alcohol prices were a little high, but still acceptable. The soft drink prices apparently were set by someone from Paris or a stripper, because at $4 for a soft drink, I expect someone to be dancing around nearly naked (or at least be on the Champ d'Elysee, with a snooty accented French.) Makes you wonder who is setting the prices, because a glass of milk is just $3, but cost wise is more than any softdrink. Of note, the Fennel salad was excellent.

I ordered a standard poached eggs with hash browns, sausage and fruit. The eggs were a bit soupy and there weren't very many potatoes that came with the meal. I asked for hot sauce and all they had was Tabasco. I love my eggs with proper good hot-sauce and in my opinion any good breakfast/brunch spot should ensure that have it. The saving grace were the toasted baguettes that came with the meal, perfectly toasted and buttered and the nice assortment of fruit as well.

We gave rent-a-son about 4 days notice - and they charged us a 400 penalty.  \n\nVery upsetting experience, I would not recommend them.",
