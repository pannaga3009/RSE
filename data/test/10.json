The flavour was decent but not the cut we paid for.  Probably best to keep going to the BBQ place at Valleymede and HWY 7 (north side) in the plaza with McDees.",

After that, I vowed never to come here, but after 5+ years, I figured I should try it at least once... \n\nI kept seeing glowing reviews here about the great char-siu wong (bbq pork king). I see comments like the best in GTA, so I had to try it out. At $28 for the made-to-order char-siu dish, I was expecting something that would be on par with the best. Sadly, I've had better bbq pork from fast food take out places (Richlane, Kum Hong BBQ, etc...). It was slightly cold, suggesting they just warmed it up. The edges were burnt, but the outer layer wasn't crispy. They put way too much honey making it too sweet. Worst of all, the pork wasn't very tender. Was quite disappointed... \n\nThe bbq pork at Skyview fusion (Woodbine and Hwy 7) is way better. Also I would say the one at Dragonboat is also better. Heck, even the two fast food bbq places I mentioned are better. This place is also quite expensive, especially considering the food is not that great and the place is very rundown. \n\nOh, and this place has got to be the only BBQ place I've seen where the meat in the display cabibet looks completely unappetizing! The cold  char-siu has been sitting there all day and is all shriveled up from rigamortis. Very likely been dropped on the floor few times as well! \n\nShould have trusted my gut instinct from 5 years ago and never tried this place... Not coming back.",

					"text": "Of the 6 Cantonese BBQ places I have tried in GTA, this one is by far the best of all.  If one wants to get a comparison since Cantonese BBQ has different styles, I would point to Big Wong BBQ off Mott Street in NY during the 90's (it's different now compared to back then).\n\nMy favorite:  their crispy skin pork and char siu (red roast pork).  The crispy skin is not just crispy, it breaks up in a crunch fluffy kind of way, with the layer of fat soften to the point of near melting point but still there, and the meat is moistened perfectly.  Now bear in mind:  you need to make sure you get there earlier vs later (after 2 pm) when the meat is very fresh to achieve this desirable effect on the taste buds.  And always try and get the part of pig near the kidney area for the most tender juicy flavors.\n\nAbout some of the other Yelpers complain on service and higher price:  seems kind of trivial to me personally.  The slightly higher price simply reflects the higher quality (which naturally takes more labor to produce right?) of the BBQ offerings.  More labor, more time means more money/costs.  As for service:  I was polite and the lady cashier was very polite.  I would guess the younglings on Yelp were less than courteous, and in response and fairness, received the same type of indifference from the cashier.

Now THAT is class.\n\nOne of the key reasons for their five star award, is for John's nailing down and doing the DEFINITIVE preparation of what is translated to be \"princess chicken\", sometimes casually translated to \"yellow fur chicken\", or Gwai Fei Gai. Old schoolers also know this to be Bak Cheet Gai. Basically a steamed or poached chicken that if done right, is superbly fragrant on its own from the marination and prep, surpassing the best Singaporean style Hainan Chicken even (yes, and please don't gasp in horror that I said that) and then all you need is some shizzletastic sauce called ginger & scallion oil to dip in, a bowl of rice, and suddenly you be da King eating out the Princess (chicken that is, sorry that sounded royally rawng). \n\nEvery table at John's has a sheet describing in painful detail (in Chinese) how each Princess Chicken is made, and the amount of seasoning, Chinese herbs, and the whole process itself, is a legend and probably deserves its own Yelp review. You would be amazed to learn how extremely laborious in nature it is to make a Princess from scratch, and yet it is so affordable and luxurious in taste. Sadly I misplaced that sheet of paper, and my AZN character typing skills aren't up to par, so we will have to revisit the gorey details some other time.\n\nBut trust me, this is the bestest, sexiest Princess you will ever have in your life, tender suckalicious breasts and juiciest thighs. Most of the time the breasts end up being too dry, but John knows how to prep her to make you weep. The last time I had princess this good was at an old restaurant in Wanchai Hong Kong (Tso's) that is no longer around, back in the 80s.\n\nRoast duck here is also sexcellent and I'll bet they have roast goose as well (where it is not illegal unlike south of the border). Of course one cannot miss the cha shiu here as it is pure porkgasm.\n\nI can't wait to come back to John's again, and literally be a King at the table of roast beasts and princesses.",

					"text": "The BBQ meats here are the only items I find excellent. Served hot, the meat was succulent, especially my favourite BBQ pork. The BBQ pork is a perfect balance of sweet and savoury. The soybeans underneath were an extra treat. They were sweet and so flavourful that I could have had them on their own.\n\nThe items on the main menu are fairly pricey. While the food is certainly satisfying, I wouldn't consider the price point proportional to the taste. They do have a special menu (all in Chinese) with smaller dishes that are all $7.99 that my family usually orders from. It allows us to have a variety of dishes without breaking the bank. Beef with bitter melon is a simple dish, but one of our favourites here. The size of the dishes are smaller of course, but the quality doesn't differ too much from the main menu. \n\nWhat really detracts from this establishment is the service. Having eaten at more than my fair share of Chinese restaurants, I do not expect extremely attentive service (nor do I really desire it), but the service during my previous visit was borderline rude. One of the servers walked away when she saw us come in, and brusquely commanded a co-worker to seat us. When we ordered our food, the server asked condescendingly if all the dishes we ordered were from the special menu. The complimentary desserts (yes, I know it's complimentary but still) were put onto our table while we were still a considerable ways from finishing dinner. \n\nPerhaps I'm being a bit dramatic, but considering the fact that this is not your average Chinese restaurant, I did hold a slightly higher standard. They are also capable of exceptional service, as evidenced by my first visit, when I was with a larger party and ordering more expensive dishes. The difference in service was also noticeable during my last visit, when there was one party holding a feast in the adjacent room.

This required a $50 payment in advance.\n\nThe roast pork was amazing. The meat was tender with just the right amount of fat, but certain pieces of the meat were a little too burnt. The bbq honey sauce they used on the pork was really good.. It had the perfect consistency and flavor. There was also a small layer of beans hiding under the meat.. I was a little surprised to see this, but it actually worked. The roast duck was excellent as well. The skin was crispy, and the meat was very juicy. I didn't eat too much of the steamed fish, but it was pretty good from what I tried.

What a shitass experience. And turns out their take out combo portion was the smallest I have ever seen. For 18 bucks we got 2 small pieces of chicken together not even bigger than a regular sized thigh from Popeyes. And the two fried egg sized BBQ pork were soo dry and tasteless.

There are no Tvs, games etc. so be prepared to entertain yourselves and your friends with good conversation. I loved the fresh popped popcorn that was available to curb my beer infused munchies. The popcorn and the soft pretzels offered are the extent of the food served here however food trucks have been known to frequent the parking lot. After sampling 2 beers ( I had 2 of the 3 IPAs served -- my fav ) we came to the conclusion the beer is pretty good ! One strange drawback I found was there is no printed menu; they have drawings of each of the beers above the bar but the lamps made it difficult to read and for those without great eyesight nearly impossible .

When I pulled upon the PB sign, I drove into an unmarked gravel parking lot. However, I turned around and saw the PB parking lot sign so I drove around and parked in their own graveled lot.\n\nWhen I entered, I was struck by the cabin-in-the-woods feel. There's wood everywhere. Also, they don't seem to have a fully functioning A/C. This was a hot, July evening and the inside was stuffy, to say the least. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for beer, so I was very appreciative that they had a wine list. I ordered a glass of Riesling which ended up being just as clear as tap water poured in a wine glass. Thanks to my coworkers, I was able to sample everyone's beer selection. The peach flavored beer (I forget the actual name) was not a favorite, the saison was good, and the lemon flavored beer was a little bit of a letdown as well.\n\nThey have a food truck on site, Lake Norman Grill, that serves a limited menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, fried pickles, fried mac & cheese bites, pretzels, etc. I ordered fried pickles and was given a buzzer to wait for my food. Once my buzzer beeped, I picked up my food and brought in to share with my table. Completely underwhelming.\n\nAlso, while at PB, I went to the bathroom. HUGE negative that they have only ONE stall/toilet for ladies. Why is this a thing?! \n\nI'm very thankful for the fact that my job paid for the beverages because I cannot see myself going back to PB to pay for a drink.",

They have corn hole, life size Jenga, and shut the box!  Which is very addicting and your friends will love it! \nWe never heard of it before, but heard it's a popular southern game. I see why! Something small like having games or activities will help keep people engaged, and that means more beer sales since they are staying at the brewery.\n\nWe spent about 30 minutes at Crafty Beer Guys, had one beer and then went to Primal. Where we spent nearly 2 hours because we played games, which kept us buying more beer. Also unlike Crafty Beer Guys (2 miles up the road), Primal sells flights, which is a great start to try new beers before you pick a random one. \n\nI also love when breweries have stickers.

They stylist said that she would ask the manager about it and the manager belts out Infront of everyone that they do not cut extensions because if they mess them up they've had to replace them.

Policy is one thing but when it's not posted anywhere in the salon , on the website and not even in the employee manual you have to question if this is policy or preference .

It was a group of 6, so we really did not want to loose our reservation. They could not have been any more helpful over the phone! Directions were provided, and they kindly held our table until we arrived.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly escorted to our table. Our server kindly welcomed us and wished my two cousins a very happy birthday and memorable meal. After we all ordered our entrees, we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary appetizers for the entire group (halibut ceviche which was to die for!!). Their bread rolls were extremely delicious and always kept coming. Water was always replenished without even asking. Always a step ahead those people! When it came time to receiving our entrees, the wait staff made sure that all our orders were correct before setting them on the table. The dinner was then completed with complimentary sorbet (made in house). Everything was delicious!!! No one had any complaints about anything.\n\nThe service was excellent; above and beyond my expectations of any restaurant. I have been to other restaurants like Delmonico's at The Venetian for birthday celebrations, and none match the superb service and attention of Delmonico.

One of the better potato side dishes I've ever had!\n\nCreamed Corn Gratinee: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. The breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n\nBone In Rib Steak: Server asked me if I wanted Emeril's Essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. I told him that I wanted it the way it should be served.. Shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident Emeril Magic Dust \"BAM!\" sprinkled over  the meat. It was a healthy portion and did look Fantasteak! Not the softest steaks I've had but had a Nice Chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. No Complaints! \n\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie: Came Tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. There was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. A great way to finish a fine dinner! \n\n*Also had a glass of some French Honey Wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n\nBeing A FAN of Emeril For Years, Had High Expectations.. The Place Delivered but Not with Flying Colors..",

They start you off with these fresh out of the oven dinner rolls that you can never get enough of, but watch out that you don't fill up on it.  The steaks are worth skipping some bread for.  I always go with the aged prime ribeye on the bone.   It never disappoints and this time since there is a ban of foie gras in Cali I opted to try it for the first time as a topper.  Please don't mock me for never trying the foie, well I can you can, but as a Yelper/foodie I had to try it for my street cred.  I thought it was okay, I just I'm not as much as a foodie as everybody else.  It was just some extra fat for my steak.  I would recommend the banana cream pie for dessert, it was amazing!  Bravo!\n\nThe Bad:  Only thing I would say it that you will be having a slow dinner.

Birthday girl had the filet mignon. Sides included smashed potatoes and broccoli. \n\nBone in ribeye: Humongous! Probably 20oz. +  Beautifully crusted, with just the right amount of seasoning. Steak as always, cooked perfectly medium rare, which made for an amazingly juicy and flavorful experience. \n\nFilet Mignon: Now normally I am not a filet person, but I did try a piece or maybe two.  Beautiful crust and to my surprise it also had excellent flavor.  Tender as you would expect from a great cut of Filet Mignon.  However, still not as juicy as my steak was.\n\nService as usual, impeccable.  Insanely large wine list, with almost every wine imaginable.  Complimentary amuse bouche and bread are also delicious.",

Delmonico did not disappoint, they delivered on par excellent service and quality food in a classy but intimate ambiance. We have already arranged to go back in the coming Vegas trip. The steaks, as you would expect, were above expectations in taste, searing, and quality of beef. Most importantly in order to enjoy a good meal you need impeccable service along with it. It was the kind of service that is very professional and classy but in a way that makes you feel welcome and comfortable, not stiff and robotic.

Four other couples flew in  from all over to celebrate with us and the first problem is that they seated us at a table for 9. The hostess called that morning and said 9, I corrected her and let her know there were 10 and she said she'd call me back by noon to confirm but I never heard back. Regardless, this Open Table reso said 10 so I didn't worry about it until we all sat down, realized we were one short, and had to get back up and go wait in the bar. \nWhen were seated at a proper table, the appetizers that I'd pre-ordered were sitting out on the table, including fried oysters which had gone ice cold and soggy (very gross). We had to ask for bread long after entrees were served and it was cold, mushy things that looked like they used to be popovers (I thought I'd remembered a wonderful bread service before...?) And so on with the poor service...\nI've eaten here before and service and food were five stars. But the bone-in ribeyes were bland and not well-marbled, the bone-in bacon was 100% bone-in fat (of course bacon is very fatty but there was NO meat to be found at all) and the service was severely lacking in detail and common meal planning skills. I could list all the issues but you get the picture. Very disappointing. The best part of the meal was the fresh oysters in the seafood tower, very fresh and delicious.",

I don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so I know him as the big guy with a beard. He was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their seafood tower with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from New Mexico!).\n\nWe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other Yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. So hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. He would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nONTO THE FOOD!\n- Bone-in ribeye: Duh, do as all 1100 Yelp reviews say and get this! Fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. And yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- Fingerling potatoes- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. Really tasty and beautiful. Sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- Creamed spinach- Not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. Perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- Lobster bisque- if you get this, I would highly recommend sharing. It's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- Penis-shaped pop-overs (as another Yelp reviewer notes)- Try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nAt the end of the day, I would certainly come back for the food.

We had a show to attend at the Wynn so we needed to dine locally; I was debating on dining at CUT again or here but due to the high yelp reviews we decided to give Delmonico's a try.  I made reservations one month in advance online and notated our special occasion. \nUpon entry we were both promptly greeted, seated and our anniversary celebration was acknowledged - which was much appreciated. Service was kind, professional and very efficient but unfortunately the food - lacked significantly. \n\nWe both began with the recommended BBQ Shrimp appetizer - which was phenomenal, but unfortunately that's where our ecstasy of taste buds had ended.\n\nI ordered my long awaited alleged highly reviewed bone in rib eye with a side of foie gras, mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. \n\nTo my unfortunate disappoint - the steak had tasted no different than a steak purchased from your local grocery store. For the price point and most importantly the anticipation I had for their signature steak from the world renowned chef, it DID NOT hit the spot. Although the steak came out at a perfect temperature and presentation was adequate, it did not at all taste like a typical dry aged high grade meat - very bland and mediocre, tasted no seasonings or flavor. We should have gone to Mastros or I would have at least been better off going back to CUT, although I didn't like the fact that CUT brings out their steaks lukewarm (due to resting) or not even on a hot plate - but you definitely get the high end meat quality and the explosion of flavors - hands down by far is 100% better.\n\nMy wife had ordered the Mediterranean Sea bass since she wasn't in the mood for steak and as well to her disappointment it was a lackluster, flavorless dish. All in all it was a very disheartening anniversary meal after a month's of high anticipation especially with all of the other fine dining options we had in Vegas.",

For example....\n\nA few days before one visit, I called to request that the Peanut Butter Cream Pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. When we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an ENTIRE pie just for our party. It was unbelievable.\n\nAnd oh the food....\n\n** Warning: this meal is a marathon. If you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** Appetizers ****\n-- Lobster bisque is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- All the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- Skip the tuna tartare and tomato soup -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- The free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** Wine ****\n-- For those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the Fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. It goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** Steak ****\n-- Ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- Try Au Poivre style for really powerful flavor. Steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- I am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but I have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** Sides ****\n-- Usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. They're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- Twice baked potato (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. Two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- Mushrooms are some of the best I've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- Broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** Desserts ****\n-- Oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. You will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- Banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. It is also enormous.\n-- Skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.",

We had eaten at the original location in New Orleans when I lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. This one definitely tied that experience.\n\nAs other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. The steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. We all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the \"OMG!\" and \"MMMM!\" and \"wow.wow.wow.\"  They all had the filet mignon, and I had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. It came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and foie gras butter just melting into it. \n\nHave you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? It's worth coming here just to try them. \n\nEven the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was STILL good (shocking, I know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n\nThe other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  Places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. Our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n\nThe design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of Vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. Great to have that feeling of privacy.\n\nWe lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.",

There was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. The restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. The lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.\n\nDelmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. This slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. If you're at Delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n\nFor starters, I had the Lobster Bisque Soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it! Best Lobster Bisque I have ever had. It came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. I am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n\nWe also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies.

Perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! I can't rave enough. The steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n\nThe food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. Definitely a place to experience while out in SIN CITY!",

Went with a group of 9 and ordered the \"surf and turf\" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.\n\nThe good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.\n\nThe disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n\nI'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n\nWeird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.",

Game on!!\n\nService is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.\n\nEach section has its own host and several supporting cast.  Some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with him/her.  They usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.  Always different and always outstanding.  It's no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.  The food will be brought as per normal or as you request.  You're in control so let them know what you want and they will help you better.  Even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.  The place can get a lot of hustle (not normal) so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.  They won't rush you so don't rush yourself.  \n\nI go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.  I highly recommend the Wet/Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye Medium.  The outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.  Inside will be pink and juicy (order med/rare if you want blood) and soft not chewy.  The meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling (great now I want one).  Desert?  The steak is desert enough for me (lol).  \n\nService is impeccable.

The ambiance was fantastic and maybe I enjoyed myself so much because we went here with a group of 18 or so right after my husband and I got married in the Venetian but here's the breakdown. \n\nThe appitizers were really great, the parmesan chips were thin and had wonderful flavor. We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist. \n\nMy brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had. \n\nWe had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice. \n\nThe reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks.

Prices are typical of a business lunch environment with appetizers around $15 and entrees $17-24, for the most part.  \n\nFirst off, the popovers are addictive.  You get 2 to begin and I imagine I could've put back 5 if given the chance.  The lobster bisque and lobster sliders were fresh and completely satisfied my shellfish craving.  The bisque at lunch was $13 ($18 at dinner, so a great deal).  The sliders were $24 and came with 2, lobster-filled sandwiches with Cajun-seasoned fries.  The bisque was creamy and an insanely good compliment for the dipping powers of the popovers.  The sliders were a little bland as far as the totality of the dish, since it was simply tasty bread and lobster, but still fresh and meaty. The bisque comes highly recommended - one of the best soups I've had in Vegas.\n\nThe meal came out quickly and we were in and out in less than an hour - perfect for a business meal.  Delmonico is one of the best business lunch locales in Vegas.  Well done Emeril.  Full and satisfied, knowing you put back some great food, is the perfect feeling walking out after a nice lunch.",

If you are a patron of New York steakhouses such as Peter Lugers or S and W,  or excellent national steakhouses such as Shula's, like myself, you may not enjoy the steak cuts.  My New York Strip was fairly tough, and required some heavy cutting considering the $50 price.  If you can't cut a $50med. rare steak with a serrated butter knife, I don't want to eat it.  It probably has some good marbling as it was juicy and moist, but it had some tough fibers that were definitely not meat or bands of marbling.  This may be expected in a ribeye where tendonous material often lines the outer rim of the steak.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience with great service, but 3 stars because of meat cuts.",

I noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the TV which soured the mood. Once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. Our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal. \n\nThe meal itself was very good, especially my Bone-in-Ribeye which is their signature cut. It's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a Cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. It paired beautifully with the Bourbon-Bacon Manhattan I ordered at the bar. My dining companion had the New York strip which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the Bone-in. Like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. However both of the sides we had (The Wild Mushrooms and the Spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. The appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the Parmesan-Truffle Chips but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.",

The 1st time being within it's 1st month, the last several weeks ago.\n\nMy 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.\n\nTurns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n\nWe ordered 3 Rib Eyes, 1 Filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. For sides truffled potato chips, mashed potatoes and corn.\n\nWhen we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n\nWhen our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n\nBack to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n\nWill not go back.",

The atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in Vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? Anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. So, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. We all shared the caesar salad prepared table-side. It was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. I ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. I thought that gumbo would be Emeril's thing! It was slightly cold and WAY too salty. It was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl. \n\nI had the filet mignon and it was okay, and I wish I had ordered the duck. I can't really say why I only thought the filet mignon was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and I had just finished up a super salty gumbo? \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. Would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? Probably.

However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.\n\nMy friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.\n\nPreviously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5\n\nMy lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5\n\nFor dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.\n\nWhat was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.\n\nI want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.\n\nI'll be back.",

The service here was excellent.  The atmosphere was American classic.  The noise level was moderate.  We were able to have a very good conversation where the whole table of 6 was engaged the entire time.  The cocktail menu was imaginative and the Old Fashioned's tasted nearly as good as mine.  The wine list was interesting and navigated well by one of my work colleagues.  The popovers to start as the bread option was a nice touch.  Popovers were \"a thing\" in my youth, my Mom loved them, and for me it's always sweet to have them in a restaurant.  For my entree I had the filet mignon and it was perfect.  Others in our party had the bone in rib eye and the bone in sirloin ... all were happy.  We ordered 3/4 of the sides on the menu and all were well done.   We all ordered dessert and 1/2 the table went with the banana cream pie and the other 1/2 with key lime, both were good, but the key lime was the winner.  The net-net for this Yelper is that I would be happy to go back here anytime.  Delmonico rates 5 stars and two thumbs up.",

Our servers were on top of everything but not intrusive & the manager, Rene, was friendly  & knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.  For our appetizers, we had oysters on the 1/2 shell, wilted spinach salad & heirloom tomato soup.  All were yummy.  We've come to realize that splitting a steak between 3 people is the way to go.  In the past, half our steak would go to waste as these steaks are huge!  We split a bone in ribeye and there was still a couple of pieces left over. The reason you get so full is because the sides at Delmonico are out of this world! This time around we had the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach & creamed corn.  I could make a meal on Delmonico side dishes alone - they're that good!  While they've served up delicious desserts in the past (what? No more bread pudding?), we just didn't have room for dessert this time.  I can't wait until we are back in Vegas again & have the time to stop by this gem of a restaurant.  It's true culinary bliss!",

To be handed pages upon pages to browse on top of the other spirits, wine menu AND cocktail menus made my damn head spin because I wanted a lot of things. I settled on getting the Scarlet Starlet which had Glenmorangie 10, Tuaca, lime, hibiscus, strawberry and egg whites.

Very much worth the $16 in alcohol and skill in mixing- the bartender Michelle was great.\n\nAppetizer I got VINE-RIPENED HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD (With Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil) which was standard, but good because the components were quality and fresh. \n\nEntree I got PAN ROASTED ATLANTIC SALMON( With Sweet Corn & Crab Vinaigrette and Fresh Basil) which was nicely cooked and was very fresh and clean. I liked the large pieces of lump crab mixed in with the corn. \n\nDessert the hubby and I shared:\n\nBANANA CREAM PIE PARFAIT(Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs) was a solid dessert that could convince someone who doesnt like banana cream.

I had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak I ever had.  It tasted like cheap top sirloin from Sizzler, really tough & chewy.  Emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  My daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the bone-in ribeye, which was delicious.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... I understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  I'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.",

					"text": "As I have been to the Emeril Delmonico restaurant in New Orleans and enjoyed it immensely, I decided to have dinner at the Delmonico Steakhouse located in the Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino where I was attending the Phantom of the Opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences. \n\nFirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.\n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the \"Creole\" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nThe main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nSorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  The meal described above with tip was roughly $210.",

We didn't have room for dessert but was treated to an ice cream waffle cone with a delicious flavor to celebrate the man's birthday. \n\nOh yeah, don't be shocked by the 100 page wine list or the bottles ranging up to $37,000. You can find some reasonably priced options! We will be back!",

The only minor complaint I have this time is with the cocktails. Too much ice and no garnish. For the type of restaurant it is, it should also not be using regular ice cubes from an ice machine. The drinks should not only taste good, but look delicious as well. \nI would not hesitate to come back here.",

I ordered the signature rib-eye with a side of wild mushrooms.  The wife ordered the braised beef ribs.\n\nAtmosphere: The wait-staff was nice and the person takimg our order didn't seem to mind that I asked if they had beer (they do) as opposed to ordering a glass of wine.  Lights weren't bright, a bit dim for my liking, but the area was very spacious.\n\nFood:  The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, not under, not over, just right.  Nothing fancy for the seasoning, just good old salt and pepper.  A nice seared crust on the outside, nice and tender on the inside.  However, I wouldn't call it the best steak I've ever had, but it was very good.  The wild mushrooms were excellent, I would order those again for sure.  The braised beef ribs were okay, not great.  A bit too salty, but I guess that's why it was on the Specials menu.\n\nPrice:  Well, it's Vegas and it's a nicer restaurant, be prepared to pay.  Frankly, I've paid more for steak, and this wasn't he most expensive steakhouse I've been to.  However, when my wife and I saw the bill, we both said \"oh, that's not that bad.\"\n\nOverall it was a good experience eating there.  If you enjoy steak, you will like this steakhouse.  I'm sure those that enjoy wine with their meals would enjoy this place a bit more than I did though.",

					"text": "I was in Las Vegas with my fiancé while he was attending a wireless convention for his company.  I asked a friend to recommend a good restaurant to go to while we were there.  From his short list of about 5, we chose Delmonico's.  Delmonico's is at the Venetian in the Palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  Attire was business casual.  The dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  They treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.\n\nThe wine list was impressive and started out with Kevin's picks (the sommelier).  I noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. Apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  Their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan.  Although Twomey Merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  Our maitre d', Lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  Kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the Merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.\n\nDelmonico's is a classic American steakhouse with Creole influences.  I couldn't decide between the crab cake, the ahi tuna & salmon tartare & the New Orleans BBQ shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and I was so glad he did.  It was amazing! I also had the filet. It was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. The service was exquisite.  There was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  For dessert, I had chocolate brioche bread pudding with Hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. When our server came back to check on us, I thought maybe I had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure I was enjoying it as much as he does.  We surprised Lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.\n\nI am giving Delmonico's 5 stars, each of which I feel they are very worthy of.  Dining here was not cheap, or even close to being on budget, ($450 for 2 people) but it was fantastic.",

					"text": "About 2 years ago, I had dreamed of eating steak at Delmonico's.  The reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  Delmonico's is Emeril lagasse's steak house.  It is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the Palazzo and the Venetian, right in front of the Blue Man Group entrance, across from V-bar, B&B, and next door to Aquaknox.  I've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  Suffice to say, in the past two years, I have.  In short, I have eaten at Delmonico's 6 times.  Not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n\nPros: \nWine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  However, I question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our bone-in ribeye.  I know a little bit about wine, well, who I am I kidding, I pretend to know a lot.  Enough to the point that I didn't think I'd want a pinot.  However, it was his recommendation and I thought I would go with it.  It was definitely a pinot.  Very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our bone-in ribeye (which was my concern to begin with).\nThe steak is choice (to steal my favorite John Hughes film).\nCan sit large groups fairly easily.\nWill sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a Friday night).\nExcellent sides.\nThey are fairly attentive with the service.\nThe scotch list is reasonable.  However, I do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \nThey do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  For a heavy trafficked weekend, I believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  I am interested in trying this because I think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but I'm not that organized nor do I have an event to do that with).  Well, who am I kidding, I don't even have that many friends.  Ha!  Anyways...\n\n\nCons: \nI always get the bone-in ribeye and each time I've eaten it, the seasoning (which I believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  In some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  There just isn't any consistency.\nAll but one time I've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  The fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  You are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\nThe decor is more monastery like.  \n\nThe first time I ate here, I gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  If they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, I think Delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  The steak is pretty tasty.  Its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  Well, within reason of course.  However, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  To be fair, I'd still come and eat here (cause I believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in Vegas, I've started to venture out.",

Maybe Vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...\n\nSome friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n\nOne friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n\nDelmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!",

					"text": "Steak! My first trip to Vegas was this past summer with a group of friends. We ate here one night and it's the best steak I have every had in my life. I started with the lobster bisque and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. Also two of my friends ordered the Caesar Salad which they make table side (for two people).  \n\nLobster bisque... very very tasty and rich. If you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. It also has nice size chunks of lobster in it. \n\nBoneless ribeye, medium rare...Amazing. It was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. It was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. It was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, I can't remember the ounces but I left stuffed. \n\nCaesar salad...I'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. In a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what I was told was the best Caesar salad ever,\n\nAt this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, I think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice baked potato. All was cooked to perfection. \n\nThe Service...it was the outstanding. There are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. I wasn't too sure what I wanted so I asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. I can't remember the name but it was good. I think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender. \n\nIt is expensive but well worth the money. The food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is Vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. Definitely have to go there again when I go back during Christmas.",

It was truly a sight to see.\n\nFOOD:\n**Note: Most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  Sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-Crab Bisque ($12) - Delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  This was on the Chef's special list, therefore I am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  The bisque soup is the same as the lobster bisque, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-Jumbo Lobster Tail ($48/Market Price) - As I am not such a big meat eater, a lobster tail was my alternative.  I didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  It was heaven!!  Delicious!!  Tender!! \n\n-Creamed Spinach Side ($9) - It was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  You could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-Creamed Corn Side ($9) - YUMMMMMMM!!  I must come back especially for this side!! The corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.

					"text": "What better place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and Yelp Spring Break than in Las Vegas! I wanted to surprise my bf so I made reservations through open table for dinner at Delmonico. When we arrived the hostess wished my bf a happy birthday and we were told to have a seat in the waiting room. Wow that waiting room was super nice but also packed! Lucky for us as we turned around to scan for a seat the hostess called my name and said our table was ready.\n\nUpon being seated we were greeted by our server. He also wished my bf happy birthday and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned with our water he also brought some warm, soft, honey rolls the melted in our mouths. We decided to start with the Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedge salad followed by a Twice Baked Potato ($9) and Rib-eye ($48) for me and Short Rib Special ($35) for my bf. Before our salads came out the waiter brought a small appetizer for us to share- compliments of the chef. I don't remember what exactly it was but it was so delicious!\n\nThe wedge salad ($13) was composed with petite iceberg lettuce wedges and topped with apple smoked bacon and red onion with buttermilk blue cheese dressing. There was A LOT of crumbled blue cheese on the salad- almost a little too much for me. It was enough for both of us to share and enjoy before we got our steak knifes and forks ready for what was to come next.\n\nI wish I were hungrier at the time- my rib-eye was HUGE! After the rolls and salad my steak and bf's short rib looked almost impossible to finish and it was quite a challenge. The rib eye was thick, juicy and tender- served with a slice of melting butter on top. Every bite felt so sinful as it tasted so good despite how full I was I couldn't stop indulging in more. I tried my best to eat my half of the twice baked potato. It was really smooth and rich with bacon and Vermont cheddar.\n\nI can't say much about my bf's short rib since I was too busy trying to finish my ribeye. I know he really enjoyed it and the meat was so tender it fell apart with a light brush from his fork.\n\nAfter dinner the server brought my boyfriend a complementary scoop of banana sorbet for his birthday. He likes bananas but usually doesn't like banana flavored foods. The sorbet was so fresh and smooth he actually really enjoyed it and finished! With a food coma coming on and $115 later we postponed surprise #2 (dessert at Serendipity) and cabbed back to our hotel and called it a night. Who does that in Vegas!?!? \n\nP.S. I can't wait back to try the Creekstone Farms Naturally Raised Angus, Carved Tableside for Two with Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes. Time to start saving up again...",

I am a chef, and a succesful one I've ran restaurants and now I am a private chef, so I know food and service! I was with my girlfriend and another couple, from the start we were treated like we didn't belong there. They forgot to bring us our wine for like 20 minutes. The table beside us arrived after us and recieved their wine and food before us! They recieved excellent service, getting a amuse bouch, and all served at the same time! We were treated like dishwashers. I thought the food was ok, crabcake was decent but lacked simple seasoning salt and pepper! I thought they would at least make there own bread, but no. The ribeyes were charred black and had no seasoning, filet was ok but lacked seasoning. Gnocchi was great but a little salty. All in all food lacked seasoning, waiter was a asshole, all though the manager was cool I will never step foot in there again!!!!!!!!",

Remember Erik, you didn't eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\n\nThe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao (\"A nightclub that happens to serve food.\") and Cut (\"Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.\")\n\nWe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril's New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\n\nMy wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\n\nBoth were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \n\nThe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  Unfortunately, the authentic Kobe filet I had at Fish House spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as Delmonico is, I can only muster 4 stars.",

The atmosphere is still the same great upbeat, fun and relaxing (yes all at the same time). The drinks were good as well.\n\nThe thing that lacked was the seafood tower. The highlight of the meal, the thing we were looking forward to the most, what we were drooling for. A couple of the dipping sauces were delicious but their substitute for cocktail sauce tasted like marinara sauce. Overly sweet and not a good mix with shrimp. Maybe I am biased because I love the kick of horseradish in my cocktail sauce. The biggest complaint though, was the seafood felt dry or freezer burned. We still ate it because I wasn't going to let them waste the food and was in too much of a good mood to complain, but for the $, maybe I should have. \n\nSo this trip was a love hate.

					"text": "Prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in Vegas and we agreed on Delmonicos. Delving into the menu so I had an idea in mind of what I would be ordering, I became intrigued immensely when I saw that it was under Emeril's.\n\nWe were fortunate to be seated a little early. The ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. The decor was minimal and I felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nLet me say the service was top-notch. Although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks IMO.\nThe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. I counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nAppetizer: Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: Superb. I liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. The wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. The wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nMain Course: Ribeye (no-bone). Some say the meat tastes better on the bone. In this case I found the Ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Frankly I don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. Adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nSides: All the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\nPotato Gratin: So good I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nCreamed Spinach: No joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nAsparagus: I'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. Had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\nDessert: Sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. Strawberry, Banana and the 3rd resembled Coconut. I found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nClean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.",

Utan tvivel var det den fetaste och största steken jag har ätit, och även för mig som brukar sluka stekar utan som helst problem tog det lite tid och krävdes skicklighet att få ned den. Som tur är var den fullkomligt gudomlig och tillagad precis som jag älskar.\n\nTill detta tog jag en sidobeställning på krämig spenat som var relativt standard, och inget speciellt och en förrätt som var löksoppan, och den var faktiskt riktigt god och hade en intressant tvist om att osten låg på insidan av soppan och inte var helt smält på toppen, det gillades skarpt. \n\nNär det kommer till desserten var Delmonico lite busiga och erbjöd \"Creme Brulée på ankägg\" och det smakade faktiskt inte annorlunda alls, så det var lite tråkigt att jag föll för den.

Nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of Perfection. From the smiling hostesses to the personable server, Frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for Restaurant Week. Even explained what Three Square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. He genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the RW menu to show us when we sat down. Not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (Smith&W) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. Not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. And this is just lunch for crying out loud. Service felt like you're the most important person in the world. Amazing.\n\nFrank was delightful to have as our server. He was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. Getting to know my Father and I throughout our dining experience. It was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. He was thrilled that we came for Restaurant Week and when I started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after I ordered the Prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. It felt so good that the server is all for it. Even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. So sweet and kind!\n\nThe goods... Everything. There wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. Complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. The appetizers.. My Father had the Heirloom Tomato Soup With Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich, which was so good.. I didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. He was enjoying it so much that I didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. Sh*t. I just wanted one bite!!! *sigh OH well.. I ended up enjoying the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with my favorite Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar, and Torn Local Basil. It was oh so freshly made. That burrata cheese just makes my day. Loved every single bite of it.\n\nIf you come here for RW... a must try.. DELMONICO'S PRIME HAMBURGER. On Toasted Brioche Roll With Fries, Cheddar Cheese, and Bacon. I never in my life had a hamburger like this one. It was first class, first rate, love at first bite. Outstanding flavors. Even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. So good, so good, unbelievably Deeeeelicious. The size of this burger was enormous. My Father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. Me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. I was full from eating only half of it, so was my Father. The presentation itself was like art. Even cutting it in half was beautiful. I'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. My Father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. Either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. We, both had a splendid time here. \n\nBoth desserts were wonderful.  The Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream, and Graham Crumbs had this cooling effect. It's a great sweet summer treat. Thick cream. The Traditional Bread Pudding With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce was soothing. Generous amount of pecans. It was a seal deal to a great meal.\n\nAfter the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in Vegas. I never had a burger impress me until today. Superb!!! Fantastic service, food, and ambiance. Lovelovelove this place :)",

This was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a Vegas concierge for many years. That being said, I thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n\nWe were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. The waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and foie grae with cherry compote. Not bad. I started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. The lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n\nI asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the Rib Eye in Bone. It saved the meal. As juicy as any steak I've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. My wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the Lobster Bisque which she also devoured. The sides were OK. I had the Twice Baked potato with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n\nDessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. The pecan pie was excellent. The bread pudding was disapponting - I've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate Magic Shell. I sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Never a want. And the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if I included the freebies then it would have touched $400. Bottom line is I'd go back if staying at the Venetian but would try others if not.",

Not the best steak i have had, especially since the waiter said it was both wet and dry aged. \n\nSauteed spinach - Very good, but i would have preferred a bit more creaminess to it. Although i am not sure if it was supposed to be cream spinach or not, it seems almost like it was halfway between steamed and creamed. either way it was a very good side dish.\n\nFilet - Very well cooked and tender. I found the truffle crust lacking in flavor though, as i could not really taste it at all.\n\nAnd i want to say halibut, but i could be off. Either way, the special fish entree was probably the best of the night. Cooked just right, and the sauce was excellent.\n\nOverall i liked the dinner alot.

They aren't overly friendly, the barely look at you and they speed you to your table, but that's where I wanted to be anyway. Service in every other way was impeccable. I was pretty impressed with the waitstaff from the start. They were amazing.\n\nSat down and only had water between me and the business associate I was with. He declined an appetizer, but I chose to have the half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were tiny, but delicious. I definitely would recommend these if you enjoy nice, mildly salty and briny oysters. They had a lot of flavor for the size.\n\nWe both ordered steak; I had the bone-in ribeye and he the filet mignon. I also ordered the foie gras to top my steak.\n\nMy steak was a nice size and it was cooked medium rare with the outside being a little tough and very seared on the outside making it tasted burned almost. I ate around that and was pleased. It isn't the best steak I've ever had, but the prices were reasonable so it hurt less. \n\nThe foie gras was tasteless and a waste of money. I like mine to be buttery and melt in my mouth. Not happening here, save your money. There are a lot better places to get it.\n\nMy associate had the filet and I tasted it; it was tender and moist. It was cooked perfectly, but the outside was pepper coated and it tasted bitter. Not a fan of that.\n\nFor dessert we split the banana cream pie and it was the best part of the whole night. Highly recommend! It tasted like something my mom would make and I loved it! It was big and we couldn't finish it. I bet it would have tasted awesome right out of the fridge the next day, but alas I left it there. \n\nAll in all it's an okay restaurant.

Being an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, you had to expect the best.  \n\nOne of my previous reviews of an expensive steakhouse stated that I could not imagine paying outrageous prices for a steak considering there are only so many ways that you can prepare it.  With that being said I still believe that is true, however I did not pay for my dinner this night since it was for Business :).  \n\nDelmonico's is located in The Venetian Resort and Casino right across from the Mirage.  I have always thought the Venetian was one of the more classy places to go in Vegas and Delmonico's was no different.  We called ahead to put our names in for an 8:00pm reso but we got there early at 7.  Some of us were dressed in shorts and flip flops, but since it was Vegas I think thats why we got away with it.  After checking in they said they could seat us early and to take a seat at the bar to relax.  After ordering a few drinks, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  (On a side note, they have an extensive Scotch list which includes some very rare 100 yr old Scotch's for $150-200 a pop).  We sat down towards the kitchen and was greeted by a stunning blonde waitress...I believe her name was Dale, but I could be mistaken.  \n\nWe took a look at the menu and this place is not cheap.  You are looking at around 50 bucks for a steak.  Most of us ordered the Ribeye which is my favorite cut of meat and you can either get it bone-in or not bone-in...22oz or 16oz respectively. We started off with BBQ shrimp which is what they are known for and Ahi Tuna and Salmon Tartare.  Both of these were fantastic.  Our steaks came out quickly and they were cooked perfectly.  The sides here are a la carte and each could easily feed at least 4 people.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes and it too was quite delicious.\n\nAll in all this place was amazing....They have a team of people, 3 to a table, to make sure your water is always filled, bread is on your plate, and that you have everything you would need.  \n\nI was mesmerized by our waitress and was inspired to tell her that she was stunningly beautiful.  She was an excellent waitress too haha.  \n\nIf you are looking for a good restaurant in Vegas I would definitely give this one a try.  Be prepared to spend some money, but it was well worth it.",

While my gf order the shrimp pasta and that was unbelievably oily if you are going to cook with sausage one knows hit has natural oil so you dont need to fill up the frying pan with extra oil, someone needs to question the cooks they got.  Baked oyster was alright it was tasty, but buttery and oily as well, but still flavorful.\n  The only thing good about this place is the service.  The main waiter was very helpful when choosing a cocktail.  The servers where very friendly as well.\n  Bottom line: This place can cost over $150 person, depends what and quantity of order, skip the food at this place just come for cocktails.\n\nThis place got two stars for service and cocktails.  Would have gotten four if I was describing a lounge or bar.",

Yes this place is on the pricier side, yes the portions are huge, and yes its an upscale place. But you pay to play in Vegas so that is exactly what you receive here. The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service. \n\nThe menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here! \n\nThe must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.\n\nThe next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends. \n\nWe will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip.

The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I've never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I've had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it's amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch.

Our service was nothing special, but we weren't even told about some of the specials that we saw as we were walking out the door.

I had a \"green spade\" which had cucumber, basil, and some other stuff in it. It was light, not to sweet and delicious. He had a bloody orange, which is a whiskey cocktail, and he loved it equally. I also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. They were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. We were seated 15 minutes early. We told the waiter that this was our first \"casual fine dining\" experience, and he was more than informative. Made suggestions throughout the meal, and was personable and forthcoming. They had a nice \"Our top Picks\" for the wine. We chose a mid-price cab sav. They gave us complimentary truffle cream for an app, and then we ordered the tuna to go with it. The tuna was just average, but we live in Cocoa beach, so it's hard to impress us with seafood. The main event was the bone-in ribeye. I have eaten a shit ton of steak in my life....and DEAR GOD. This steak was impeccable. I didn't need a knife, I used my fork to cut it. The seasoning was just right, and I ordered mine rare, and that was how it was. My husbands was just the right medium rare....and perfect. Now, the only negative part of our meal. I ordered fingerling potatoes and asparagus as our sides. I had to send the potatoes back. They were nearly raw, and dry. The asparagus was edible, but boring. At nine dollars a piece, I expect a little zing. We were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it was great.

There were a lot of us and the staff was courteous and knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.  \n\nLet me preface my review of the food by saying that I don't eat red meat.  I know steak is their speciality, so I was knowing order what they don't go best.  I started with the shrimp cocktail, which included 4 large shrimp, cocktail sauce and some garnish.  The shrimp were cooked very well, but it was a regular shrimp cocktail.  The cajun marinade imparted a little extra kick, but nothing remarkable.  Next, I had the snapper entree.  Almost everyone else at my table ordered the rib eye, which was enormous.  Like Man vs. Food big.  The piece of snapper looked so tiny in the bowl next to the big steaks!  In all honesty though, it was a regular portion.  The lentils were a great addition, as were the brussel sprouts.  However, the fish seemed to have been sitting out for a while.  The top was dry like it had been under the heat lamps.  I understand that it's tough to coordinate one peice of fish when you have to prepare 15+ rib eyes for the same set of tables, but that snapper still cost me $40.  I didn't have dessert since we brought a cake, but the coffee at the end was good.  I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to Delmonico, but knowing there are so many other steakhouses in Vegas that have a stronger reputation for seafood, if it's my choice, I'd probably choose to go elsewhere.",

Whatever the case that shouldn't matter because I was there for the RIB EYE!!!\n\nDisappointing... hardly marbled... flavorful yes, but tough enough where I couldn't enjoy every bite.  My pallet favors texture over flavor and although my wife felt the steaks were flavorful, in my opinion the toughness completely buries any goodness from the flavor.\n\nWhat really lowers the score for Delmonico is the sheer fact that it's surrounded by so many other steak houses, I mean it's Vegas after all!! Because of this, I don't see myself EVER coming back",

They had really good bread to start off with and they made the best tasting whisky sour i've ever had from their bar.  I got the new york strip steak and it filled me up and tasted great.  it was a very quiet place too, most of the people there were older and drinking wine.  i'd go back if i ran into a lot of money, but i'm content with $12 steak.",

The ambiance is nice although the decor is a bit spartan, the wine list is far more than my gin-drinking brain could ever comprehend, and to top it all off the service was on another level:  There were like three dudes running around bringing us stuff and clearing plates all night.  And you wanna know about attention to detail?  The one thing Vegas has heretofore *never* gotten right was the after-dinner espresso.  Never hot enough, or no head of crema, or just awful tasting.  But Delmonico's brew was not only good tasting, but they actually warmed up the cup!  (The coffee snobs among you will know what I'm on about here.)",

My personal favorite is the bone-in rib eye, but all of the meat is fantastic. I order mine rare, so it is easy to get a tough steak, but not here!!! It is just lie butter.... Yum.... The BBQ shrimp are amazing, and homemade truffle potato chips??? Wow.... I could go on and on.... Creme Brule is amazing, as is the bread pudding.\n\nI simply can't say enough about Delmonico's.

However it is located in the Venetian hotel which has seriously gone downhill from the last time I was there (maybe '05-'06).\n\nService was great, and friendly too. However the food was ehhh, on the border of \"ok.\" I ordered a filet cooked medium, but I got well (even burnt along edges). My bf ordered the ribeye cooked medium, and he got a true medium - a little pink inside, nicely cooked outside & edges. Our table shared mushrooms (wouldn't recommend, bland), country mashed and au gratin potatoes (both ok), corn (tasty!), and creamed spinach... Only thing was, we never got it. I think we were so busy eating and talking that we didn't realize it till afterwards. I guess it happens.\n\nSo all in all, this place is ok. It doesn't rank above the norm, nor would I drag it down... It's a middle of the road type steakhouse.

					"text": "My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico's on a trip to Vegas  in July 2013 - for dinner on the 4th of July.  The restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great Yelp rating we chose Delmonico's instead.  \n\nPrior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  Our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  I should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  However, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  Both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  From the second we walked in the door it was clear that Delmonico's was not that kind of place.\n\nThe entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  The restaurant looked closed.   Then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  They looked up our reservation and sat us right away so I was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  Unfortunately, that was just the start.  \n\nThe hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  We thought it was weird but went along with it.  As we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their iPads! We were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  We looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  When our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.\n\nFinally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  The waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  Did he find us a new table? Did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? No. Instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.\n\nAt this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  We ordered the table side Caesar salad and the chateaubriand to split.  The salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  The steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  After the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to Otto instead.\n\nI did use the restroom during the meal.  This was another disappointment.  The restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  You felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards. \n\nOverall, the experience at Delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  With so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose Delmonico's.",

					"text": "My rating is based solely on my experiences at the bar and Max Solano's mastery of spirits. I kind of treat Vegas like a giant tapas restaurant and basically go from restaurant to restaurant having an app and drink at each stop so I cannot comment on their food or service other than the apps that I have had there which have been delicious.\n\nMax Solano is Emeril's master mixologist in Vegas and I believe he creates all the signature cocktails for Emeril's Vegas properties or maybe it's just the Venetian/Palazzo properties. Whatever the case may be this man can make a drink. Do yourself a favor and sit and the bar when Max is working and let him design or recommend a drink based on your personal tastes. I have given him just two ingredients that I was craving and had him invent a cocktail for the first time right there in front of me that would rate as the best I have ever had. He is a true artist behind the bar. He also boasts what is one of the most extensive whiskey inventories in the country!\n\nA cocktail or two by Max is a great way to start or end an evening and sometimes both in the same sitting but either way add a Solano cocktail to your Vegas must do list the next time you visit Vegas.",

					"text": "First, I want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via Open Table though Yelp. It was easy and I didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. Big ups right there. I even received a confirmation email the night before (although I had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nOur server name? Michael Jackson. He didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. He was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other Pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our Sig Zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nWe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. I guess they like to encourage Las Vegas locals to come down more often. It was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. After that we ordered the Truffle Oil and Parmesan Potato Chips and Emeril's signature cajun New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp appetizers. The potato chips were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. Add the Parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. One of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. The large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\nI ordered the special Bone in Rib Eye Steak. It was perfectly cooked to medium. The thing was pretty large and I finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. My good friend ordered the Filet Mignon Medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. I actually secretly wished I had ordered that instead.\n\nOurs sides consisted of Potato Gratin, caramelized Seasonal Onions, and Creamed Corn Gratinee. They all were excellent in their own right. My friend described the Potato Gratin as the single best dish of Potato Gratin he has ever had. Myself, I thought that the Seasonal Onions were spectacularly sweet. They blew my mind and I almost loaded up on those alone. The Corn Gratinee was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. Although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\nOverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. It was worth every expensive penny I could slam on the credit card. I would easily recommend to anyone the experience. Reservations are highly recommended. One last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from Michael. That was really nice.",

I'd rather you not have 4 restaurants in Vegas but 1 really great restaurant.\n\nI picked to go to Delmonico for  my bday lunch since I had other plans for dinner, and the fact that I love a good steak.  We arrived around 11ish and the place was dead. The service was just not good, even on a quiet day like this?!\n\nWe got sitted. Waiter wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He came when we were ready to order, soups and entrees and a side, then he turned to leave, but I reminded him that we haven't ordered our drinks.   The drinks are usually the first thing servers asked!!\n\nWe were left alone in an empty quiet room. We got our bread from a different guy, who was a little friendlier.  But it drove me nuts because everytime he would put a roll on our plates, it was upside down.  The little round fluffy bread was facing downwards twice! I know it's not a big deal, but for the price of dining here, I expect a little more attention to details from the servers. And the butter was still frozen.\n\nMy Lobster Bisque was pretty yummie. But my Filet Mignon was just average. I had to add more salt and pepper to it.  For half the price, I could get a better tasting Filet Mignon at home.\n\nMy bf on the other hand had the burger, it was gigantic and very tasty. I wished I had gotten the burger instead, and it was much cheaper too.\nIt wasn't the size of the meal that I was looking for, but a tasty meal with the service in par with the price we pay.\n\nSo in the end, my steak chowing experience at Emeril's famous steakhouse was dissapointing and tasted average. If only the service were superb, it would have changed the whole experience of dining here, but unfortunately the service wasn't there either.\n\nEven as we paid the check and was walking out, the lady at the front desk said thank you but was looking elsewhere, why bother?",

So I ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n\nSoup: Lobster bisque was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  Often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  Not the case with this bisque.  A must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n\nAppetizer 1: Butternut squash ravioli w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n\nAppetizer 2: Crawfish meat w/Crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  And just the right amount of that Crystal Hot Sauce to give it a solid Southern kick.  This was probably my favorite.\n\nI did have a taste of the various meats too including the T-bone and filet mignon, both of which I recommend.

I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.\n\nThe three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.\n\nFor the entrée, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.\n\nI also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Crème Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.\n\nThe restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey.

Yes I answer and don't ever doubt me again. \n\nFirst let me mention they have one of the best wine lists in Vegas due to the Delmonico in Miami closing down and sending 500+ wines to this one in Vegas. Sorry that your other restaurant closed, Emeril, but thanks for the amazing wine.\n\nFor appetizers we had a sampler plate that consisted of BBQ shrimp, cold crab legs, and truffle oil potato chips. All three were great but the truffle oil potato chips were freaking amazing! These were the first chips I have had in years and I am so glad I chose these to break my no chip policy. \n\nFor main I went with the filet mignon very rare and it was delicious with the perfect amount of dry rub and no sauce, just the way I like it. Their sides are served family style and I love that. We had the wild mushrooms, creamed corn, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nOur dinner lasted three hours thanks to the amazing wine and they never once rushed us to leave. In fact, every time I came back to the table from the restroom (remember lots of wine) they had refolded my dinner napkin. Now that's some damn good service right there! \n\nThe ambiance is classy with all white walls, rounded ceilings and an open layout. Cheers",

It was a really delicious piece of meat. It was cooked medium rare perfectly. As if the steak wasn't rich enough for us... we decided to add on the seared foie gras. Very good piece of fat! For the sides, we ordered the corn, cream of spinach, broccoli and buttered asparagus. Much needed to counter the meat. \n\nService was excellent as you expect it to be.

					"text": "Food: 4 \nService: 2.5 \n\nDelmonico's was one of the first fancy-schmanchy places I'd eaten at in Vegas. However the last time I ate there was close to five years ago and I've eaten at many other places since then. My husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be. \nIn summary, I'd say the food was good, the service- not so much. \nWe were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. I was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service. \nFor the appetizer, I had ordered some sort of tomato salad thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. In fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. However, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if I would like to order something else. The weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, \"We're out of that, do you want to get another salad?\" I'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, I definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. Perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps I'm expecting too much? I settled on the salad with goat cheese and I do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads I can remember having in a long time. However, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. My husband had a pretty standard garden salad that I tasted and it was pretty good too. \nAnother problem with our ordering is when I tried to order my filet and they asked how I wanted it cooked, I told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. Okay, I know I am a little difficult but I've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, I did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. Well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. Uhhh, what? Really? It's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. It was so weird. So I was a little miffed. With that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. Just a shame that I had to get hazed about it when ordering. All our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either. \nEven though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as Carnevino, I did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. Other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three. \nI can never resist dessert so I got something I believed was some sort of banana tart. I was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. I took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me. \nAll in all, I would say the food was good but not as good as I remembered it five years ago. Or perhaps I've been spoiled by the different restaurants I've been to since then. My biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. I would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. Understandable, we've all had bad days at work but I don't like feeling like the scapegoat. \nI still wouldn't hesitate in recommending Delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps I'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.",

So we did some research and ended up here.  Seated promptly at our reservation time on a Friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room.\nAs others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  Not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  Our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  But, and I quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain Aussie steak chain.  Girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  The $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  Little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when I asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  For grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  Not even squash!  A squash ravioli was on the menu, but not being served that night.\nLoud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was NO decor to the place.  Maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine.\nThe wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault.\nService was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  And it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food.\nLast complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  I don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in Tasmanian Devil cartoon shirts.\nSorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.",

Well, I don't feel that way so much any more after our last two visits\nService is outstanding.  No complaints when you're pampered.  But there are tons of staff which may explain the prices here. Looked to me like a 3 person team was assigned to 3 tables. Doesn't include the guy bringing the food or the floaters moving about \nThe quality of the food is merely average. 3 of us went, total bill was $360, no drinks.  The BBQ salmon was good, but the overpowering BBQ sauce hid the salmon flavor. My better half had the rack of lamb which she sent back for more cooking because it was raw in the middle. It came back hotter but nearly as raw. She gave up 1/2 through because of all the fat and the rawness. I tried a rib and found it average.  Costco has rack of lamb. Not as meaty but more flavorful than Delmonico.  But that depends on the chef. I had the bone in rib eye, asked for it med rare but it was mostly raw. The tail end was all fat. The flavor was average. For me, part of the cooking process is to turn a steak into a masterpiece. It starts with a prime cut of beef. Apparently, they were out of prime quality steers. This steak had no marbling, just huge fatty areas and lots of tough connective tissue. The tenderness and the tastiness you find in the outer rim of a rib eye wasn't there.  I had to saw through every piece of this steak. Maybe I had a crappy knife.  We had the cream corn and smashed potatoes, both were average. \nEverything here I could have made at home with better quality and with way more flavor for 1/4 the price. So I'll leave with Foodie's Helpful hints:\nStart with better quality ingredients. Learn what blue, rare, medium rare and so on are. Learn the point when to remove fish from the heat so it retains its natural flavors and moistness. Don't drown anything in sauce.  Spend some time in the kitchen outside working hours, experimenting, getting the broil and grill times right. Add alittle spice to the popovers might make them really stand out. Allow those steaks to sit outside the refrigerator to warm up before plopping them on a grill. It makes a huge difference  Add fresh corn to the creamed corn. Maybe that will add a little crunch instead of leaving a baby food texture. Liven up your tired old spuds. Liven up all your food.\nOverall the food quality is 2 stars. The service adds another star.   From now on, we will come here only for the $12 slice of Banana Cream Pie, which is to die for unless the quality starts slipping.",

When an apparent miscommunication resulted in receipt of Sauteed Spinach instead of Creamed Spinach, a side of Creamed Spinach was voluntarily and quickly brought to the table as well, without charge.  Both dishes were outstanding.\n\nOur Restaurant Week lunch culminated in a fine finish with a rich Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs for me; and traditional Bread Pudding with lip-smacking warm Caramel Pecan Sauce for Diane.  For us, based on past experiences, there is every reason to return again for more epicurean delights.",

I haven't heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it. \n\nAs we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn't too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn't finish it. \n\nWhen I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn't able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn't complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn't order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \n\nIt was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \n\nI liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome.

					"text": "I'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. The bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. Just eat it. Go. Do it.\n\nNow for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:\n\nDelmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  What a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside. \n\nThis trip to Las Vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. I wanted to visit Delmonico again, because I had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.\n\nSo we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). We knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good Sonoma Cab Sauv we recognized.  \n\nThe chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  It was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds \"hey bitches...I'm comin' for you...get ready!\"\n\nWe were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and I had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-American to pass up on such things).\n\nWe decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side Lobster bisque. The salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). The bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. Flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. I had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).\n\nI had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the Filet Medallions. I must impress upon you again that the Bone-in Rib-eye IS the way to go. It is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. There is nothing like it. It is a HUGE cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. The hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  I honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because I didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  I let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. We had a side of asparagus as well, which I felt very bad for because I gave it very little love. I hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but I wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so I had to be courteous of tummy room.\n\nNow that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. Top notch. All the way around. Polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. Well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are true to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like Delmonico or Craftsteak, etc. These guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.\n\nTotal wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what I expected at ~$300. Well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.  \n\nLook folks, even if you're not an Emeril fan (yes he owns the Delmonico name), you can still love this place. A) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, B) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and C) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet Earth (someday). \n\nTrust me folks...when in Vegas...eat like a damned king. Treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...ENJOY!!",

					"text": "Steak Lover's motto: A steak cooked beyond medium rare is fit only for dogs.\n\nLike many a Vegas Steakhouse, I feel like the excitement and constant crowds provide easy business to this high-end restaurant and that easy patronage has caused them to rest a little on their laurels. \n\nThe service I received was adequate but not commensurate with the price level of this restaurant. The side dishes were very good. The steak was also very good, but at this price, it should have been exceptional. \n\nThe ribeye was very tasty. It obviously came from a happy, well-fed and fatty bovine donor. The unusual cajun seasoned rub was also a unique and complimentary twist. It was cooked to the requested temperature (rare), and it tasted great. My beef with their beef is simple: it could have been served with a hotter searing, on a hotter plate, and in a larger portion size. For the price, I expect a larger steak than this, and for that reason, I would probably go to Mastro's next time. \n\nThe meal was good enough that I would still go here again for another try if I get dragged along by other friends.

On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I've had 10's before in Vegas, so the competition is tough! But just claiming you have the best steak doesn't make it so.\n\nThe sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four.

Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter.

My girlfriend had a fillet of halibut over a sweet potato risotto and I had the 22 oz bone in steak rib eye.  I had a taste of the sweet potato risotto, and I thought it was delicately sweet with an interesting flavor.  The halibut  was, well, halibut.  My steak, on the other hand, was a real treat.  The bone does weigh the steak down a bit, but it was still thick and juicy.  It also came with three dipping sauces, which were tasty, but also masked the flavor of the beef.  I'd say use them sparingly.  Another complaint about the actual bone was that it kept the steak from being cooked evenly, one side was noticeably bloodier than the other.

The wine list was extensive and had great choices. As an appetizer we were offered a mushroom dumpling that tasted fantastic. The downside was, it was a bit cold on the inside. The popovers also had lots of raving reviews but again, I wasn't impressed and they were also a bit cold. A tableside Caesar salad was our choice of vegetable. It was tasty, but about one notch above mediocre. We both ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, and were very happy with that cut. The flavor was spectacular and cooked to perfection. The grits with cheese and bacon, I was supremely unhappy with. My better half enjoyed them but I just did not care for the way they tasted. Too much like corn and they were not smooth at all. As a birthday treat, I was presented with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream that tasted very..... pumpkin-y. It wasn't bad but I couldn't finish it.

SOOOOO delish. :D\n\nI will return for the truffle potato chips. :D and rib eye!",

					"text": "I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\n\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\n\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.",

I'm writing this review half a year after eating here so I don't remember specifics, but I do remember my scallops were very salty (but tender, and huge). What wasn't huge were certain cuts of steak, which basically came in a little cube. Service was amazing though, and the decor in clean, white, and perfect lighting. The inner dining area was better looking but empty at the time, I think they were trying to seat everyone to the outer sides of the restaurants first.

Lights are dim.  \n\nThe device was top notch we we greeted immediate as we sat, water came out, and wine list brought to us. It was my wife's bday so we were definitely having a glass. Their drink menu had several options of wine, cocktails, etc.  \n\nThe croissant that they bring out was fluffy and buttery. The knock is they bring you just one. I could have eaten 20. I'm sure if asked I could have had another. \n\nI ordered the bone in New York strip and I have to say it was by far the best strip I've ever had. My wife ordered the ribeye and I did try a bite. While tender and tasted well. It was slightly warmer on temp than she liked. My strip was better. But by no means was her's bad. The twice baked potato tasted awesome and we shared an order.

After waiting for 5-10 mins, perusing the menu on our own, I had to ask a busboy to find the waiter so I could order drinks. He finally came over and asked if I had any questions and proceeded to recommend the entire menu. Not helpful. We ordered the organic green salad which was excellent. Also got the bone in ribeye. I liked the way it was charred on the outside but it was not well seasoned and the meat quality wasn't top notch like other steakhouses I've been to. The manager came by to do their customary check and I told him the steak was 'pretty good'. He didn't bother asking me why I wasn't satisfied, smiled and walked away.\n\nOverall, this place doesn't command the price they're charging. Need to clean up their service and food quality.

I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that's what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. \n\nNEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\n\nCAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It's big enough to share with your entire party.\n\nBONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn't wanna make a mess, that's why I opted for boneless. I've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn't take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\n\nNOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\n\nFor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\n\nCan't go wrong with Delmonicos.

Bunch of my friends had lobster bisque which was rich but very good as well.  The rolls came with a small amount of butter on them and would taste great in the bisque, I'm sure.\n\nFor steaks, everyone went with either the New York or Filet.  I had the filet topped with seared foie gras.  The combination of the two was excellent and very flavorful.  I sadly had to leave some foie gras left over because it was too much.  I tried the New York and that was great as well.  \n\nFor sides we had the potatoes au gratin asparagus.

By the time I looked up again, my water had been refilled.  WOW!  The waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  Then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  I chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  They scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  It was 7 minutes in HEAVEN!  The mister and I both opted for steak.  He has the filet mignon and I had the bone-in NY strip.  We decided to share a twice baked potato with cheese and bacon.  His filet was just a filet.  My NY was HUGE!  If I had known it was going to be so large, I would have gotten a filet too.  I was only able to eat half of mine and was not able to have any potato.  The mister finished his steak and all the potato plus his bread which I didn't touch.  The steaks were cooked med-rare perfectly and seasoned.  I could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  It wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that I didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  I was stuffed full of steak but I needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  We shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  The crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  We had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  I think the mister was slightly disappointed that his filet mignon wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  OH WELL!  I enjoyed my steak and I enjoyed being tended to like a princess.  I had a great night, it would have been better if the darn tables weren't' so close together.  I would have given it 5 stars, I just didn't like being able to hear what the people next to me were whispering about.  The prices were fairly reasonable for Vegas, we've spent double at Yamashiro's and Redondo Beach pier, plenty of times.\n\nDon't let the dress code fool you too much.

					"text": "I have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  My search has put this place on the top of my list.  After years of waiting I finally  was able to dine at the famed Delmonico Steakhouse in Vegas.  I was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nMy wife and I arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  The ambiance while very nice, was not what I had expected.  It was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered up my usual (Goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  We chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nFirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  We settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nFirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  I liked it that they brought you a single roll so I couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so I really didn't want more than one.  Probably for the best though.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the gulf shrimp cocktail which was excellent.  The shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  They give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although I could have eaten them all myself.  If you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nThen we had the Caesar  salad which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  While the salad was pretty good, I wouldn't order it again.  They add some spices to it that I just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nAs per our steakhouse usual, my wife and I split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  It wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  The steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender I am looking for.  At 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nFor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the fingerling potatoes.  I guess they were pretty good but I should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like creamed spinach or mashed potatoes.  My wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time I'm ordering something good.\n\nMy wife and I are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  It was ok but I would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  I wasn't a fan of the crust but I was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nAfter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason I had absinthe.  The after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  I asked if I could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  Instead, I settled on one and it was very good.  I am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so I really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  I still have no idea why the heck I ordered it.\n\nMy entire Delmonico experience was excellent.  Our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  The price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  Anyway, I would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.",

What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I'd say the food part of Emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn't feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\nI don't mean to rip Delmonico's so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-baked potato\" + \"Asparagus\" was fantastic.\n\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar's Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\n\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.",

The server was delayed in taking our order, the food took so long that my colleague had to ask the server to check on the status, and then just getting our bill was extremely difficult.  I am not driven to return.  The food was nothing over the top incredible...  especially with the high price tag on the items (Lunch for 4 people was $120+ including tip).",

Although this made me sad I can honestly say I make a kick ass gumbo that taste better but I owe that in part to the many episodes of Emeril Live I've watched, lol. The Sirloin Strip Steak was cooked perfectly but it was lacking in flavor. It tasted like plain meat, no BAM and it was definitely not kicked up a notch. But the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream made up for the steak. It was everything a butter cake is suppose to be, buttery, fluffy and just delicious goodness. Because I am a heifer I ordered the Banana Cream Pie too as this is a signature dessert of Delmonico's and the server sweared it was the best dessert on the menu. He lied, lol.

Our reservations were at 10pm Sunday night we got seated right away. \n\nI do feel bad for giving 1 start because the service was EXCELLENT. However the food was soo dissapointing. We ordered calamari to share- the marinara sauce that accompanied it tasted like Ragu from a jar. Like I said 7 girls with 1 order of calamari there was more then 80% left on the plate. We then got our salads which i have nothing to complain about then again it was just greens and dressing- I ordered the cowboy ribeye which they are known for and the most popular menu item. I ordered it Medium. We also ordered creamed corn, spinich, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus. \n\nCowboy Ribeye Steak- WORST STEAK EVER!!! it was over cooked too chewey and tasted old- I thought maybe it was just me but I had 3 of the girls taste and they thought the same- Really dissapointed :(\n\nCreamed Spinich- Undercooked \n\nPotatoes Au Gratin- Good but not the best I had ever had lacked flavor\n\nAsparagus- Cant go wrong with that\n\nBottle of Wine was excellent we had the Cuvee\n\nBottom line we were really dissapointed.

You will never be disappointed.  Kevin is a wealth of knowledge and will introduce you to wines that you may not have heard of or tried before.  The great thing is that these wine selections are of great value. \n\nFor large parties, definitely call ahead and secure a reservation.

					"text": "I decided to take my wife to Las Vegas for our first anniversary.  She'd never been to Las Vegas, but had always wanted to go.  She asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  So after doing a little bit of research I stumbled upon Delmonico.  With a name like Emeril Lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? I went to the website and looked over their menu.  The prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  I really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because I would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when I saw them.  However, we only have one first anniversary so I decided we should go for it.  \n\nI called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  She asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  After I explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.  \n\nWe arrived at Delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  We were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  She immediately said \"Happy Anniversary\" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  At about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  A table for four quickly became a table for two.  All the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  The serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.  \n\nDrink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. \"Courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary.\" said the server.  It was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  I hate blue cheese but I ate it anyway, and it was quite good.  \n\nThe server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  The server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.  \n\nWhen it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  It basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  She loved it.  She also got the Filet Mignon, and buttered asparagus.  Her steak was amazing, I tried a bite of it.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best Filet Mignon I've ever experienced.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  \n\nI ordered the Delmonico signature cut, a bone in Ribeye.  Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  I've been eating primarily Ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that I was ever happy with other cuts.  I also ordered their take on creamed corn.  The Ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best Ribeye I have ever encountered and probably ever will.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a Ribeye.  It was amazing.  The corn was really good also.\n\nOur server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  Written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was \"Happy Anniversary\".  It was pretty good, I'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.  \n\nEven with the complimentary dessert my wife and I couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  We chose butterscotch Creme Brulee.  It came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  It was amazing, and probably our new standard for Creme Brulee.\n\nAll in all our experience was awesome.  The food was outstanding and the service was great.  My glass never got empty.  Every time I finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  After the 2nd or 3rd roll, I looked over towards my wife, grinning.  The server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, \"You know that is going to keep happening.\" I told my wife that when I was over the rolls, I probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. It was funny.  \n\nI would recommend Delmonico to anyone who is in Vegas and looking for a great place to go.  I would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  I think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  They had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  Remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.",

A nice touch that we noticed toward the end of the meal was that although the restaurant was almost at capacity, no diners were sat at any adjacent table leaving us secluded for the entire meal. We had a few bonus tastings added to our meal including two complimentary celebratory desserts. And at the end of the meal, the friendly manager who was overseeing our entire meal, escorted us to the kitchen where we had a brief word with Chef Rainwater and photo op.\n\nIf you're looking for a cocktail, check out their creative list which some of the drinks looked very interesting, but I just stayed with my Irish whiskey. The wine list is also extensive enough that they carried a couple of choices for my picky wife. Emeril mainstays such as the barbecue shrimp and banana cream pie are items that you should try at least once. The poached main lobster was a special for the night that did not disappoint. The highlight for my meal was the bone in ribeye with Creole seasoning topped with maitre d' butter. I savored every bite of the dry aged beef and I don't think there's much doubt that I could have eaten another one.\n\nThe tab was just over two bills which I had no problem with the splurge and felt it was well worth it with the gracious hospitality we received.

I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant! \nPrior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready. \nWe were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu. \n\nI decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore. \n\nFinally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday!

The Apex and Sema Convention were on town so the restaurant was packed. I had a ribeye steak which was good however the baked potato I ordered was cold along with our other sides. I will give credit to the manager who did remove the sides from our bill.  The bone marrow toast did not taste like it had any bone marrow at all and the BBQ shrimp was just ok.    I was very disappointed especially after spending  $388\n  I wasn't aware the convention was in town or we definitely would have come another night. when your spending that much money on a steak I think the service and meal should be outstanding",

Most would give this place a 3-star review, but I thought that it deserved a 4-star review.\n\nMost in my crowd thought that the steaks were poorly decorated.  But I was not sure what they expected - steak is steak.  And my filet tasted well enough.  It was cooked well for a medium rare plus, which is hard to do.  So I was impressed enough.\n\nI also shared salmon with someone, but that definitely could have used more salt.  That surprised me considering that this is Emerald's restaurant, where butter and salt is what he *BAM!* loves.\n\nBut I had some sides here that I thought were pretty amazing.  The buttered and gratin'd corn here is delicious.  My friends other hand, felt underwhelmed by their mushrooms and asparagus, which I guess I would have to tend to agree.\n\nThey did have an excellent wine list, however.  I got some bottles of Shafer Relentless for less than double the retail price, which is a great deal considering that I was at an upper-end steakhouse.\n\nLastly, what is noteworthy is that this tends to be a pretty good scene.

It was seared and just so good. One order of mashed potatoes is really big so our waiter recommended we shared. We did not even finish that 1 order of tasty mashed potatoes.

This is a chain restaurant so some might be skeptical, but overall I think this is one of the better restaurants of the chain (as I have been to several of the Delmonico restaurants). The service was great as usual and for the price point of the steak, I think one of the more affordable steakhouses in Las Vegas for what you get. \n\nThe bone-in rib eye - cooked to perfect medium rare and the one thing that Delmonico's adds to their steaks is a big chunk of herb butter that just adds so much more flavor to the steak (although you know its bad for you, you just want more!). \n\nSides - great for sharing and we had the mixed mushrooms, creamed spinach and creamed corn.

They took my plate away and returned in 10 minutes with the same steak now hot but black (for real) on the outside and thoroughly well done.  Plate was set down and off the server went to another table.  10 minutes later he saw it sitting there and asked if it was not OK.  I again repeated what I had ordered.  Then, with some attitude he said, \"Let me just start over on it\".  Fifteen minutes later a new steak hit the table and again over cooked.

However, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  I informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  Water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nFood:  We started off with the Caesar Salad and Ahi Tuna/Salmon tartare.  I thought the salad was just ok.  A tad too much dressing.  Same with the tartare.  Nothing special and pretty bland.  Most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  All were cooked well.  I thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  Nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  I had the rack of lamb (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  I would take Carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  The sides we had were decent (Potato gratin, mushrooms, and corn).  We had a nice bottle of wine that the Sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  That was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nThe verdict on Delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  I would choose CUT over it any day.  They have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).",

One for water, one to clear and one to serve. Maybe not specifically, but it seemed that way. \nThe chef sent over a complimentary appetizer for the table; lemon ricotta served over thinly sliced red apple and bruschetta with tapenade and pesto. (I think a green apple would have been much better. I dont care for the texture nor the taste of red apples) The appetizer was very nice. The soup followed and I didnt care for that one bit. It tasted like warm ketchup. Ew. Ew, ew, ew. So not a fan. Thankfully, that was the only dish I didn't care for. The grilled cheese that accompanied the soup was very good. I enjoyed that quite a bit. The tomato salad and the house green salad that others ordered looked absolutely delicious. Every one finished everything, so I guess they liked it too.\nThe salmon entree was delicious. I asked for it cooked well done and it came back, cooked fantastically! It wasn't medium at all and it was so juicy. Even Christina who likes hers cooked much less, said it was very good. I tried her butternut squash ravioli. It was OK. The flavor in the ravioli was good, but it 1. should have been warmer and 2. the pasta was too soft. It should have been al dente. \nThe dessert was good as well. Your choice between banana cream pie or pecan pie. I opted for the pecan. It was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was good too. I tried Christina's banana cream pie, and it tasted good, although I didn't care for the look of it, with all those squares of banana. \nThe service was very good, they didn't add the 18% automatically (I prefer when places do that, honestly). The food was good, not great, but good. The price, $30.13 for 3 courses was OK. It was \"pricey\" for lunch, however, the quality of the food and the portions were generous.\nI dont really see myself going back there.

Our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.\n\nWe started off with Delmonico's Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  Excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (I love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.\n\nNext we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  Seeing as I was in a steakhouse and that I-like-a-the-beef, I naturally went for a steak.  On the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled USDA prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  Got mine in a nice medium rare.  Boy oh boy, was this a winner!  Tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent I say.  I usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, I did not need it!  I sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  The side of Country Smashed Potatoes were good too, but you can guarantee I kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  It's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks I've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  I took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  Delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.\n\nWe ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, I cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because I really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  But yes, that tart must have been pretty good because I do remember finishing that as well!\n\nQuickly looking at the actual menu, Delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  Most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  Not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!  But then again, if you are rich I guess everyday would be a special occasion.",

					"text": "We started with some lobster bisque that was very good.  The rolls were just OK.  My bone in ribeye was very disappointing.  The outside was heavily charred.  The cut itself had much thicker sections of fat than any ribeye I have ever ordered.  After removing most of the carbonized surface, I finally was able to try the meat below.  It tasted like a regular steak.  Not prime, and it lacked the tang of an aged steak.  They told me it was wet aged 3 weeks and dry aged 4 weeks.  I find this hard to believe.  The service was quite excellent and the only reason they are getting 2 stars.  That's twice now I've felt cheated dining at prime steakhouses on the strip.",

					"text": "We went to Delmonico's in the Palazzo/Venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  While nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  The service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.  \n\nThis is an Emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  I started with the Ahi and Salmon Tartare.  A nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  The lobster bisque arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  It was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  The petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  I finished with the Halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  It was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but I enjoyed it.  \n\nThe rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  I did try a bit of my GF's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  The ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  \n\nOverall, especially for the price, I thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just OK.  Not a place I'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, I don't think this really hits the mark.  There are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in Vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.  \n\nInterestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no Delmonico steak on the menu.  I thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)",

					"text": "3.5\n\nI had high hopes for Delmonico, as many had said some great things.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured it was just another celebrity chef restaurant, so I had my reservations.  The place was well decorated and had a great vibe.  The food was up to par and certain items had great taste, such as the lobster bisque.  I was hoping for more with the wilted spinach salad, but it was still OK.  The complimentary amuse bouche was a nice touch, tasted like a truffle cream of mushroom.  Now the steak, everyone says to go with the bone-in ribeye, so that's what I got.  Tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  Not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  Service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  Forgot our truffle potato chips and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.\n\nNot sure I'd go back with all the other many celebrity chef restaurants to try, but it's definitely one of the better ones.",

We began our meal with bbq shrimp, bone-in bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were delicious.  Now on to the steaks. We ordered bone-in ribeyes and this was by far the best steak I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. For our sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  We finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n\nLet's talk about the staff and the service.  From the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  The three gentlemen serving us were Rene, Brian, and David, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  They were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n\nThe ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  We had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n\nDefinitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. We will definitely be back.",

					"text": "Emeril's Delmonico Steakhouse is located in the Venetian hotel, slightly across from the Blue Man Group Theatre. To be honest, I even liked Chef Emeril much. Never cared about his shows or his cooking. Guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at Delmonico. We made reservations through Open Table for a party of 12 on a Saturday night. We wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (FYI, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). We weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. Gave us plenty of time to digest and chill. \n\nWe checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. Barely five minutes passed and our maître d' came out to fetch us. Unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. However, he took care of us the entire night. I apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: Caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him. \n\nThe establishment is quite simple but still very classy. It's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. The dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. You can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. It's an elegant and clean look.\n\nWe all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. We figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. After recently having some awesome buffalo in Wyoming, I decided to order the Three Peppercorn Crusted American Buffalo Rib-eye with Caramelized Cipollini Onions and Brandy Peppercorn reduction ($50). For those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. It well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. Personally, medium rare is the way to go. I sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and I have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. A few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. Not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.\n\nFor sides, we ordered two of the following to share: Sautéed Garlic Wild Mushrooms ($11), New Orleans Creamed Spinach ($9), and the Creamed Corn Gratinee ($11). It was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. All sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.\n\nEverything could not have gone smoother. The 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. Service was top notch. Occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. Our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. The chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. That could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. Even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house Delmonico is. I am quite impressed with what Chef Emeril has done with this restaurant. Big Props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. I do look forward to future visits.",

					"text": "Time to splurge and allow yourself to fall into a deep state of pleasure. \n\nAfter trials with off strip, inexpensive eats, we decided to make this meal a good one and it was definitely good alright. \n\nI don't usually give five stars, but I don't see what holds it back, so here it is. \n\nFirst, this place is pretty large and accommodates reservations pretty easily. I suppose it's not new and hot, so it's relatively simple to get a table during a desired time. \n\nWe had solid service. Everyone was so nice, even after we decline getting wine after many minutes of searching through the list and talking to a sommelier. Yep, we were those people. \n\nWe ordered: \nthe ribeye (25oz) which was split for us two\nthe wilted spinach salad\nbarbecue shrimp appetizer \nRoasted fingerling potatoes\nkey lime pie desert.\n\nThe wilted salad wasn't wilted bc we asked for the dressing on the side, but it was pretty good. I didn't love it bc of the bacon fat vinaigrette, but the fried egg was an interesting touch. The portion is quite small, so not really that shareable if you're wanting to get some greens in your diet. \n\nThe barbecue shrimp was fantastic. It comes at a hefty price of $18 for five shrimp, but it's pretty worth it. The shrimp were juicy and plump and very flavorful. It's more Cajun/new orleans style, so don't think it's some traditional southern sweet BBQ. \n\nThe steak was delectable. It had a perfect crisp layer on the outside and a good medium rare redness on the inside. For the most part, it was really a good marbled piece of meat. Even at 12 oz each, I could barely finish it, but I was riding on the potatoes...\n\nWhich were pretty bomb too. Steeped with garlic and herbs and butter, these potatoes were cute and perfectly seasoned and cooked. Just soft enough to melt in your mouth but cooked enough to have some of a give when you take your initial bite. Definitely recommend these. \n\nAnd of course, seriously, the best is for last: the key lime pie. Trust me, I'm not a huge sweet tooth (even though I love love ice cream - it doesn't necessarily mean I love super sweet things!) and I don't often tend to like tart flavor profiles, but this was the damn best key lime pie I've ever had. We were recommended several things like the banana something something and blah blah blah and we both just happened to lock our eyes on the key lime - maybe we needed a refreshing dessert - but it was a good choice. By no means do I not think the others are good too - I bet they are - but this was the best choice for us! It was the right amount of tartness with the sweet (though it was a bit heavy on the sugar for my liking) and the strawberry glaze was so complementary. The crust was buttery and delicious and it all paired so well together! Goodness, the ghrelin hormones are starting to rise and they're making me hungry for this dessert! \n\nDelmonico's is a great steak place, maybe one of the best. Don't hesitate to come here for a satisfying carnivorous meal!",

This was apparent after she ordered it \"medium well\" and I shot her a look and remark of \"I don't want mine medium well, I want it medium rare\" This minor conflict turned uncomfortable for the rest of my family as her and I debated over how our steak should be cooked. (My theory - anything over medium kills the good juicy flavor) All the while the waitress was standing there, listening to us go back and forth about the steak. I don't remember how it ended up being cooked, but I do remember the steak coming out cut in half. Thanks waitress. \n\nThe food was good, I think everyone was pretty content with what they ordered.

Not just the price, but also the entrees and sides, the pairing with wine, the atmosphere waiting in line.\n\nI personally liked the atmosphere, as it was nice to have dim lighting for a late 9pm dinner. The waiting bar was nice, although the seats are very very low. A nice confidence booster for short folks, but some might find it uncomfortable. \n\nInside the restaurant, seats are very comfortable. Unlike my counterparts Don and Elmer, I ordered the standard NY bone-in steak. Very good, my only complaint was that it wasn't boneless! The wine was great; the waiter was helpful in selecting a bottle, very tasty but not too pricey for 4 near-thirtysomethings. The side dish of warm spinach salad(which yours truly ordered) was the showstealer of the night. Everyone liked it, so keep it on your radar if you go.\n \nOverall, I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars, though it would really be 3 and a half stars. If you want a better selection of steaks, probably go to Ruth Chris, NERO or the Bradley Ogden restaurants. In Vegas, the benchmark is BOA, but BOA can get very very pricey. But for the value and overall celebrity restaurant experience, a good experience. Definitely make reservations thru the casino or through opentable. I would go again with a small group or for an intimate dinner with my girlfriend.",

So much decadence and it was a surprisingly wonderful grand finale to a spectacular meal.\n\nFor the amount $$$$pent, we could've went for bottle service, made it rain, or get swindled at a rub-n-tug joint, but we indulged on a magical evening of delightful food pr0n.

I waited at least ten minutes for the steak to come back, and it was a miss. On top of that, my filet's cut was poor. The sides were fine - mushrooms and twice baked potato.\n\nI kind of felt that the kitchen and management really blew this for us. At a place with a price point like this, walking in just before closing shouldn't impact the food quality. I feel like the kitchen wanted the steak out ASAP so they could shut down for he night. On top of that, no manager came to say a word about the mistake, and nothing was done to compensate for it - no comped drink or dessert or even a \"sorry\" from the management. I think that this is inexcusable considering this is an Emeril restaurant and is quite pricey.\n\nNot sure we will return, which is too bad because we are fond of the place from past visits.",

Great find!\nThe New orleans bbq shrimp were a tad too salty for my taste, but nevertheless, delicious.\nI would've definitely ordered dessert, but I was so full that I just couldn't get myself to do it. \nIn any case, I had a wonderful time and I must implore you to try it if you are ever at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas (did that sound classy??? eh i tried).

					"text": "I'll start with this: I'm not a fan of Emeril Lagasse.\n\nWhy? I don't know. I've never really been a fan. When Food Network showed actual shows instead of Guy Fieri and his 90's hair, Emeril, Bobby Flay, Tyler Florence, and Giada ruled the network. Oh, and Michael Chiarello, but I've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. That aside, BAM! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now Emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. I always thought he was off-putting.\n\nThat being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. I've been to CUT, so I know that Wolfgang Puck is better than his canned soups. There's a chance Emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n\nThe drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. Maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n\nFirst up: the vine-ripened heirloom tomato salad with burrata. Am I supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? Are you serious? I paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? Fuckin hell. I was disappointed. Okay? So disappointed. Come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a RIPE tomato?\n\nFor the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the ahi tuna. The tuna was fine - it was tuna. I'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). The battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n\nBut the wagyu. Okay, look. You're paying $90 for a fucking steak. For a steak that ISN'T KOBE - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. And it's not big, it's small. Is it wonderfully marbled with fat? Yes! To me, it was great! I thought it was wonderful! But this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n\nWhen you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. Like, searing hot. Like on a 400F plate like Mastros, hot. RIGHT off the goddamn pan hot. When it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? What kind of $90 experience is that? The cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you RUIN the experience. Plus it was a little too salty.\n\nYou're probably thinking, \"Jesus Jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. I can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here.\"\n\nYeah, alright. I'll give you that. But you know what? I'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated PERFECTLY. I can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, I don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n\nThen, to top off the evening of great disappointments, I ordered dessert. How HARD is it to fuck this up? When you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? So you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? For fucks sake people, GREAT dessert isn't that hard! It's SO EASY. Even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! If you call that Chocolate Truffle Cake a CAKE when it's drier than the Sahara desert, and that Strawberry Shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, AND the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your Pastry Chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n\nThis is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the Strip.",

Make sure you ask the server for this menu because it's only listed on a sign outside but not found anywhere on the menu. I had the tomato soup with ricotta grilled cheese. By far, best tomato soup I have ever had. My boyfriend and I also ordered different types of steaks. We ordered them to be cooked medium rare. His came out perfect- pink all the way through, juicy tender. However, mine was VERY rare- like almost a shade of blue. For a steakhouse, this is VERY disappointing. The other issue with this is after we received our food no one checked in and it took a while for me to flag down one of our servers (we had three servers/workers for our table). So my boyfriend was almost done with his steak before we were even checked on and received a new one. Manager did come over and apologize for but a steakhouse in Vegas, I feel the temperature of a steak has to be on point. \n\nFor desserts, we ordered the pecan pie. I don't even like pecan pie and it was DELICIOUS. I was pretty disappointment with my caramel butter cake. Cake was very dry but the sauce on the bottom was EXCELLENT. \n\nOverall, okay place to have dinner.

I did not make the reservation but the person who did somehow got us the chef's table. If you are not familar...the chef's table is it's own room separate but right next to the kitchen. Because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. It was very cool. We did the tasting menu. It was all great and the portions were so large that by round 4 I was uncomfortably full...and still had the steak course to go! \n\nI came back for dinner last week with some friends for dinner. No chef's table this time...sat in the regular ole dining area. Service was pretty good and I thought the food delivered (although my initial experience was a bit more memorable). We had the calamari with an live tapenade and also the BBQ shrimp. I thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but I wasn't the only one at dinner). I thought the BBQ shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. Split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. I had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. Delicous! The andouille sausage was the star of the plate as far as I'm concerned. My friend had a ribeye and a cheddar twice baked potato and enjoyed it. Someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). All of us enjoyed our meals. I think it's a nice little \"splurge\" for dinner. \n\nI do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses.

But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.",

Desserts are rich, gooey with a multitude of flavor combos.  Just what I like :)",

I checked Yelp and found Delmonico had a really good review and made reservations for 9:30pm on Friday. The place was pretty full, with more and more guests still coming in.\n\nConsidering the price of the meal and the Yelp description we put on our \"dressy\" clothes. After we were seated a group of 6 came in wearing t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and flip flops. Oh well, that's Vegas for you.\n\nInstead of the usual bread basket, the wait staff would place a warm roll on your plate when needed. It was one of the best rolls I've had in a while. A warm soft roll with a sprinkle of salt on top. We ordered for an appetizer, the Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare Cucumber Salad and Wasabi Aioli. I thought it was a bit salty, but the bf thought otherwise. We still scarfed it down. Because it was a busy night, we did have to wait a bit between the appetizer and our entrees. But the wait staff was very attentive most other times. \n\nThe bf ordered the Filet Mignon. He said it was very tasty and melted in his mouth. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Colorado Lamb, Fresh Herb Popover and Black Truffle Reduction. By far the best lamb I have ever had. Previous times when I ordered lamb, it had a gamey taste. For a second, I thought I was eating filet mignon. The Black Truffle reduction has a nice addition. It did not cover up the taste of the lamb. The popover was light and airy and tasted of rosemary.  We shared the New Orleans Style Creamed Spinach as a side. It was rich, creamy and delicious. I didn't get to finish my cocktail by the end, so the waiter placed it in a \"to-go\" cup. The \"to-go\" cup being a hotel glass. \n\nIf I had the money to splurge again, I'd definitely go back.",

The chips aren't 100% evenly cooked/flavored but they were totally worth taking the leftovers to our hotel room. They didn't get all soggy the next day. For my meal we had the lobster sliders. When I took a bite it was something I didn't except at all but it was still delicious. LOTS of lobster meat as well.

And, of course almost three times the cost.  Actually, more than three times the cost, since the entrée comes all by itself, and you pay separately for any sides.  My wife's pork chop was huge, but virtually raw in the center.  The server explained to us that this was the \"correct\" way to serve pork nowadays.  Apparently we're behind the times, because we prefer not to eat raw pork.  She did enjoy the part of the chop that was cooked, though.  By the way, my steak was a bit more than lukewarm.  I kind of like steak that's hot.\n\nThe restaurant was very loud, and became substantially noisier as the table of eight drunks behind us got more and more drunk.  Shouting, screaming, maniacal laughter filled the section of the restaurant where we, unfortunately, were seated near them.  No one from the Delmonico's staff or management did anything to ameliorate this situation, and the drunks stayed (and got louder) long after they had finished eating.  But not finished drinking.\n\nThis is one of those steak houses where there's a primary server and then a team of two or three ancillary servers.  None of them were initially friendly, although the primary server warmed up a bit.  The others came and went almost instantaneously, with minimal contact.  For example, one server brought a couple of small popovers for each of us.  Almost tossing them onto plates, he muttered \"Enjoy your bread\" -- and was gone.  A small magic act, more impressive than the food.\n\nI really can't think of any reason for us to go back, and would not recommend this place to anyone.  But your mileage may vary.",

I went with a group for a friend's birthday, but wasn't concerned about finding food because I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one fantastic chicken or fish option. Umm...I found that place. The only non-red meat option on the menu was a bacon-wrapped halibut and I don't eat pork either (I know, I'm annoying). I asked if I could have the halibut without bacon and they told me they would have to unwrap it, but sure. Which meant my ridiculously expensive dinner consisted of a dry rock which might have once been halibut that tasted strongly of bacon. Now, I know it was a steakhouse and I shouldn't hold it against them that they aren't prepared to deal with a semi-vegetarian, but they should at least be prepared to make halibut that doesn't have the consistency of a rock. And I also wasn't impressed with the service. They got down the whole 8 waiters at a time delivering everybody's food thing, but our waiter wasn't particularly knowledgeable about the wine or the menu, except to push \"Emeril's specialties.\" And seeing as how Emeril isn't actually back there, I don't really care what are his specialities. The decor does make the most of an underground space, but the lack of windows made me genuinely claustrophobic by the end of the night. Overall, I was really dissapointed. I'd give it one star, but I don't think that's fair because, again, I'm not their target audience. But that doesn't mean I'm not paying as much as everybody else!",

It had to have been the largest ribeye I have ever ordered for one person, and It came with a slab of butter!  Really it needs more butter? It was well marbled, thick with a little char (key !),  and it had a wonderful juicy flavor. It  was extremely good as I was so full about 3/4 of the way through, but as in \"man vs food\" i trudged on !

This is my splurge dinner on this vacation. I'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. I had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. Not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a \"thank you for waiting.\" I also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. My soda glass sat empty for a long time before I was asked if I wanted another. This happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. No mention of whether I would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  Either assume that I would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that I'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. I also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. Just because I'm by myself doesn't mean I don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. I was asked if I wanted another after I was done, and I declined. It was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  My appetizer was completely delicious. I am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. It was lump crab and gnocchi. Pesto, brown butter, lemon. The crab tasted like Dungeness, the best of course. The gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that I could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  Next came the rib eye, medium, and creamed corn gratinee. The corn was good. The topping was crispy. The steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. I expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. There were bites that I felt I was choking down. I also found it to be underseasoned. When I asked for sauces, I was given three options. Bearnaise, Emeril style A-1, and something muttered of which I only heard worcestershire. I think it might have been just that. I opted for the E-1. It didn't solve the seasoning issue and I found the taste odd.  The verdict is in on the diet coke. It was three dollars and I was not charged for refills. Why keep asking then?  I don't see how that could be considered elevated service. I had a much better meal and experience last year at SW at the Wynn. I will not be back to Delmonico.",

Instead, the hostess tried to sit us at a table next to a portable cooking station and this little room where the waiters get extra plates, forks, etc. Worst seat in the house. No joke. It was after 10 p.m. on a Friday. The place WAS packed, but there were a few better tables left. Why do us like this?\n\nSo we ask for a better table. Hostess walks us all the way back out of the dining room, looks at computer, walks us all the way back into dining room, this time to sit us near the open backdoor that patrons use to go to the bathroom and the waitstaff uses to hide in in between orders. It's January. So clearly this is a great idea. NOT.\n\nI was so angry I almost walked out right then. I could understand if it was 8 p.m. and those free, better tables were being saved for someone. But it was late. We were the last customers of the night. Give us the best, free table, you idiot!\n\nAnyhizzle, our waiter shows up and man is amazing. He reads us the whole menu, which usually I hate, but he was so charming, it was OK.  Loved him. Best part of the entire night.\n\nSo they start us with a complimentary  amuse-bouche, which was declicious. So second best part of the night. And that basically concludes are positives.\n\nThe bread was so boring I thought it was running for office. \n\nMy wine tasted as if the bottle had been opened the week before. When I complained ONLY because I was asked if I liked it, the amazing waiter brought me two other wines to try. Im telling you, best waiter ever. But the wines all tasted rancid. I didn't tell him this because I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just sipped happily cuz it is Vegas and the point is to drink, OK?\n\nWe started with the lobster bisque (I've tasted better lobster broth at Whole Foods and the lobster was hard) and a mushy tomato salad.\n\n Then we shared some crazy 32-ounce ribeye that came with a puff pastry and bone marrow. I love marrow, but this was gross. And the ribeye had no taste at all. No salt. No pepper. Just grease. Where's the BAM, Emeril? Also, the steak was so hard and not medium rare, as we ordered it. \n\nThe waiter recommended the potatoes gratin. Dude, I've made better gratin drunk. The potatoes were still hard and it tasted like pure garlic. I love garlic, but this was like Buffy the Vampire Slayer killing a villian garlic. \n\nSo we left. The check wasn't bad for Vegas. \n\nBut for a special night out? Not worth your time.\n\nI like StripSteak at Mandalay so much more.

This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo's craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \n\nMy dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n\nI had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n\nWith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n\nAbout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.",

We should've gone to just a whatever steakhouse that you could have for less than $20.\n\nTheir bone-in steak ran about $48. Their appetizer salad special of the day (which I had as an entree) was $20. Don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. It said it's \"$$\", where in actuality was more like \"$$$$\". I don't think I'd go there again. My friend said his lobster bisque soup was just \"okay\" and not as good as another, less expensive place. He said it was bland and not much flavor to it. Their twice-baked potato was pretty good, but I can imagine how unhealthy it is for you. \n\nTheir setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. Great for couples or dates. And if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. That's probably the only time I'd go back IF I ever went back.",

In the end we ended up going with something simple because we were already pretty hammered from our fun in the sun.  The appetizers were decent from what I remember, but the anti-pasto salad looked like cold cuts from my mom's fridge.  It just wasn't presented well for the type of clout this place assumes.  So here I am, dining Euro style waiting 2 hours for the steak to finally arrive, chewing on my day old bologna and it finally arrives...\n\n...and it sucks!  I got the bone in rib-eye, one of my favorite cuts, and it was \"toasted\" excessively and really lacked any distinguishable flavor!  I couldn't believe that i was paying this kind of money for a steak I was making in my BBQ baby years.  And you know how sometimes things taste so, so good when you're trashed?

Every which way you look, there's some place that's being advertised as \"The Best Steakhouse in Nevada!\" or \"THE Las Vegas Steakhouse\" or \"If Elvis Were Alive, He Would Eat Here!\"\n\nNot all steakhouses are created equal -- Delmonico is proof of that.\n\nSituated in between the Palazzo and the Venetian, Delmonico is unassuming from the outside. It looks simple and classy. Once you step inside, however, you realize that comfort is their highest priority. The chairs are deep and made of the most comfortable leather. You won't want to get up when you're finished with your meal. \n\nThis was our second visit (our first for lunch), and I must say that the service was just as attentive and cordial as they had been the first time. Both of our servers were named Peter (which turned out to be quite humorous when we called out for one and they both came running), and they were extremely pleasant. They had absolutely no problem recommending dishes or letting us know their personal favorites. \n\nFor my appetizer, I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were ripe, juicy, and delicious. The accompanying cheese was a perfect pair to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Thin slivers of onions covered the perimeter of the plate, which were also very nice.\n\nI chose the fillet of beef medallions for my entree, and I was impressed with how absolutely wonderful they were. About a half-dollar in diameter and an inch tall, they were perfectly cooked, not to mention topped in Parmesan cheese and drizzled with homemade Worcestershire sauce. \n\nDelmonico doesn't need to be one of those places that wears people out with advertising. They know how good they are, and they aren't afraid to knock your socks off. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing way to enjoy an evening with good people and great food.",

My boyfriend, the meat-eater in the group, had the filet, which he claims is the best cut of filet he has ever had.  He says it was cooked to perfection and it was absolutely perfect.  And, he's had quite a few steaks.  I had bacon-wrapped sea bass with pesto, roasted tomatoes, and some potato goodness, that I can't remember.  I mean, in all honesty, I wasn't expecting to be impressed, so I didn't pay much attention to the intricacies of the dish.  But, it was amazing.

I've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing Yelp reviews, I went into this a little uneasy.\n\nMy boyfriend had paid for most of our Vegas trip, so I wanted to treat him to something special. This most definitely was.\n\nWe made reservations that morning (Thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. We arrived and were quickly seated. The decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n\nThe service was impeccable. We had three waiters taking care of us! Water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. I asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. I really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n\nLovely bathrooms though, but I expected that. A nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n\nBut now, to the main attraction: the food. Oh dear God, the food. We started with the truffle parmesan potato chips. So simple, but sooooo good.\n\nI got a rare filet mignon and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. We got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. They were good, but could have used more bacon. Then again, I think everything could use more bacon.\n\nThe meat was... quite literally the best I ever had. I love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until I cut into the steak. Chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. It was kinda Cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. It was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n\nWe surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. I went for my old standby, the creme brulee. The boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n\nCan't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. The sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. Chocolatey, but not sweet. I could snack on them all day.\n\nBut the root beer float was a work of art. Came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. Waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n\nMy boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. He used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. And he is still going crazy over that float. I think that speaks for itself.\n\nSo while at first I might have been apprehensive, I'm really glad we came here.

Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\n\nThe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written \"Emeril's Banana Cream Pie.\" I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\n\nI was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I've been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \n\nPersonally, I'm very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again.

I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).\n\nThe main dings are from:\n1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare.\n2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.\n\nThey do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.  \n\nThe main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).\n\nOverall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.  If you really want a great steak, you may be disappointed.",

I asked for recommendations from people and settled on Delmonico's. I made reservations the Monday before the Thursday we went to dinner. I checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., I was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \nWe arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a Bud Light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. We were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. The dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. We were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. Neither of us drink wine, but I could tell the selection was awesome. \nWe ordered the truffle and Parmesan potato chips and bowls of the gumbo. Both were excellent, Emeril knows gumbo. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my buddy got the filet. We also got the potato gratin and a twice baked potato. The sides are ala carte and family style. They were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. As for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! No sauce is necessary for these babies. After dinner I had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. My buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \nOverall I can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at Delmonico's. The professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make Delmonico's a place I will go to again.",

I ordered a medium rare rib eye. It was cooked to absolute perfection. Nice crust and juicy pink center. I marveled at the perfection of my steak.

Delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. If you go, you must try their lobster bisque, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories.

His best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.\n\nWe made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a very good pino noir, though I can't recall where it was from.\n\nWhen it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. Once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. Both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though I don't know I would go as far as saying there were \"friendly.\"\n\nWe all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. I got the lobster bisque, which I wasn't all that impressed with. I had better lobster bisque on cruise ship. It was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.\n\nWhen the entrees came, everything was fine. The steak was good, but I don't know that I would ever pay $50+ for it again. I asked for medium, and I got medium rare. Which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. So she had to send it back. The server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.\n\nI did like that they came with some sauces. The Bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. The sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. Our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. However, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.\n\nThe desserts were FANTASTIC. I had the creme brule, which was perfect. Soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. I would order that again in a heart beat. And we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. Definitely big enough for 2 people to share.\n\nOverall, 3 starts. Everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. When you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. And we just weren't.

He walked away before we could order drinks and we had to call him back.\n\nBut after the initial turbulence, everyone settled in and we had a good meal.  I started with the gumbo which was perfectly fine, but it lacked a little soul for me.  For my entree I ordered the burger, as mentioned.  I just wasn't in the mood for steak for lunch or any of the other entrees for that matter.  \n\nThe burger was freakin' awesome.  It didn't have any weird toppings, just the standard lettuce, tomato, mayo maybe, whatever.  But this thing was a MONSTER.  That burger must have been about 3/4 of a pound.  It stood about 8 inches high and was delivered with a steak knife plunged into it to keep it all put together.  There was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  This was a knife-and-forker all the way.  It was so much fun digging into that sexy hot beefy mama.  The fries were awesome too.

I think the big hit was the shrimp which takes about 12 hours to make that special bbq sauce. Then we were recommended to try to the bone in ribeye as far as steak. We were going there for steaks to start with but this was definitely a hit. Steak was perfectly cooked, dry aged (8 weeks i think) and we had a lovely potato gratin to complement that. I wasn't a big fan of the corn side dish we ordered though. The waiter also suggested a nice red wine to complement that.

My bar of measure is Mr. B's in New Orleans French Quarter part of the Brennan family.  Short of flying to Paris to find a fair place to compete against Mr. B's grilled lamb chops, Delmonico's certainly gave Mr. B's a run for its money.\n\nI tried Delmonico's without looking at yelp first - in some countries I would be shot for this crime - and not knowing that Delmonico's even existed.  It was after a long day of work and simply being hungry, I walked into the first restaurant that was open without even looking at the menu.  When I was seated and handed the wine list, I knew I had found the right place, almost by divine inspiration.\n\nThe wine list was more like a wine book, only dedicating the last page to single glass selections.  The rest were bottles only.  This is where I figured out I was in a place worthy of my pallet.  They had 15 different vintages of Caymus Special Reserve.  Most fine dining places maybe have one or two at most.  Of course since the company was paying and no one to split a bottle, I could not in good conscious order a bottle.  I would have been hung by the accounting department.\n\nThe waiter gave the specials of the day and I of coursed b-lined for the lamb chops like a rabid dog.  When the dish arrived you could smell the fine attention to detail that the chef had prepared.  The Colorado rack of lamb with Roasted Cipollini Onions, Haricot Vert and Brandy Peppercorn Reduction staring back at me was love at first sight. \n\nI order my rack of lamb medium rare. Anything else would be blasphemous to the animal who sacrificed itself for my dining pleasure.  The lamb was tender and juicy all the way through.  The vegetables, especially the Cipollini onions soaked in the tender juices of the lamb melted in my mouth.  This was a meal that reminded me why it's so good to be alive.\n\nMy only regret and no fault to Delomico's is I broke and tried the bread pudding for desert.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured why not.  Being a bread pudding connoisseur and having such a spectacular experience with the lamb, I had high expectations.  I will be fair and say I was offered the key lime pie instead but I stayed true to course and ordered the bread pudding.\n\nWas it bad? No but it was certainly average for the area and if placed in New Orleans, it wouldn't even register on the map.  Delmonico's is marketed as \"creole\" restaurant and as such looses a star for the poor attempt on their bread pudding.  \n\nWill I be back? Absolutely without a doubt! Will I be ordering the bread pudding? No and if have a hankering for bread pudding after your meal at Delmonico's, mosey yourself on down to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  Order the spotted dog and you will be in bread pudding heaven.  With that said, Delmoico's is in my top three restaurants of all time in Las Vegas.  If you don't mind spending a pretty penny on dinner and you're a true fan of food, Delmonico's is hands down one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.",

I was promptly greeted and seated.\n\nI knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \n\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\n\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\n\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \n\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there'll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.",

Some of my favorites from the night were the truffle and parmesan chips, pork chops, steak, and dessert (esp the banana cream pie, and chocolate decadence cake, butter cake, and flan!).

Getting the bill also took some time, and not a single person acknowledged us when we got up to leave, not a \"thank you\" or even a \"good bye\". We felt like we were being ignored, or forgotten, as we could see the people at the table next to us being looked after a lot better than we were. There was no reason for them to treat us this way.

The shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  I don't know if I could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  So dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n\nThe truffle parmesan potato chips were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  Instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n\nThen there's the steak.  We ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  Both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  What creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  Well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  Even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n\nDon't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if I pay $50 for a steak, I expect flavor.  It felt like I was eating a $25 steak.   I almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  Even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n\nIn Vegas the only other steakhouse I've been to is N9ne at the Palms and I would recommend that over Delmonico's in a heartbeat.

This is the best Steak I have, beating every restaurant by a mile. \n\nFor appetizer, we ordered Classic Steak Tartare, it came with bread and dip too, it just vaporized in our mouth. And ordered antipasto for the table to get us warmed up. The presentation of each item deserves a standing applause. \n\nWe were four of us, but we ordered plenty of items to pamper ourselves. \nFor Main entre, we ordered Ribeye, Filet Mignon, ROASTED HEIRLOOM TOMATO RAVIOLI, Truffle and Parmesan Potato chips and for the desert Caramel Butter Cake and DUCK EGG CRÈME BRÛLÉE, WOW. \n\nWe had a Vegetarian friend, the choices are too less and for that choice, the quantity was too little. They had to ordered two main entre along with appetizers to fill the tummy.\n\nWiating might be a problem to visit on a rush day, but we were lucky. Ambience is very sophesticted, formal dressing would be nice.\n\nAlso we ordered couple of wine bottles, one was cahors wine clos la coutale, the other was too hazy to remember. \n\nOverall, this place is just worth to visit for their medium rare Steak, Yumm",

Our salads were very good (Blue Cheese Wedge & Heirloom tomato), and my bone-in ribeye was fantastic. The Asparagus and creamed Spinach were okay. The food was fresh and tasty.   To finish off the meal, I went with the banana cream pie. I've seen pictures of it for a while, and it was very good, and definitely large enough to share.

					"text": "Went to Vegas with the husband to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and take that honeymoon that had been postponed for far too long.  One of the reasons we booked at the Venetian was to dine at Delmonico Steakhouse.\n\nWe originally made a reservation for lunch on Sunday but moved it to dinner as the husband was worried lunch service didn't offer all the varieties of steak.  Made the mistake of booking for 9 pm on Monday, August 20th.  The hotel was packed with a new rush of guests as was the restaurant.\n\nEnjoyed a drink in the bar before being seated and were then led to a small table where we were introduced to Josh, our primary server.  Josh informed us that we would have 3 servers that evening one of which would be a sommelier.  \n\nWe perused the wine list and then Lamont came over and asked \"if anyone had explained the menu\" to us - a jarring question in a fine dining establishment.  We decided to start with wine by the glass as we didn't want a full bottle at that point.  I asked Lamont about a blend on the list -- I inquired as to what was in the blend.  He asked me what I meant.  I clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  He rattled off one variety and then said \"and I think a Cabernet is in there\".  Lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  My husband asked Lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.  Lamont said no - they don't have garlic butter.  Really?!  This is an Emeril Lagasse restaurant!  He asked for a side of plain butter and we sent Lamont on his way.  \n\nA food runner, or possibly our third server (he never introduced himself), delivered a complimentary appetizer of tuna atop a crostini which I enjoyed but the husband did not.\n\nJosh came back with our wines.  We inquired as to whether Lamont was the sommelier that Josh had mentioned earlier and he affirmed that he was.  We expressed our surprise and disbelief yet Josh did not follow up with any inquiry as to why we asked the question.  At this point I had to talk my husband out of storming out of the restaurant.  Josh did not alert the floor manager of our question or our discontent.  It is unclear if this was because of poor training or due to the staff not being able to handle when the restaurant is full.\n\nOur salad with arugula, granny smith apples, prosciutto and champagne vinaigrette arrived and was very tasty.  We started to move past the negativity and then waited and waited for our entrees.  The husband ordered another glass of Malbec and asked for more bread, which never came.  The steaks were quite good but the extra butter was not delivered.  The twice baked potato was yummy and the side of mushrooms was divine.  \n\nThe espresso creme brulee and pecan pie desserts were very good and we appreciated the complimentary banana gelato with 'Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate but it still wasn't enough to make up for the fact that our servers' poor performance ruined an experience we looked forward to for months.  I would have given Delmonico Steakhouse one star due to the service but gave it two because of the food.  We expected much more.  I suggest you go somewhere else.\n\nFYI - Delmonico Steakhouse is a large restaurant that seats approximately 100 patrons.  The women's restroom has 2 stalls.",

					"text": "UPDATE - \n\nDelmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will. \n\nI'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - \n\nOne of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.\n\nDinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. \n\nAfter that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. \n\nWhen time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. \n\nThe pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing. \n\nAt this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. \n\nRough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).\n\nThe waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way. \n\nNot minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. \n\nThree different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit. \n\nWhen our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying \"here is your medium and rare filets\".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth. \n\n The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. \n\nAfter the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!\n\nI can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. \n\nWe passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. \n\nCan't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.",

After YELPING and looking over all the menus, Delmonico's was the winner because it was conveniently located in The Venetian (we were staying at the Palazzo), decently priced compared to CUT, and had rave reviews about the bone-in ribeye. \n\nRESERVATIONS: \nMaking reservations was quick and simple. You can make reservations directly through the restaurant as opposed to The Wynn Restaurants where you have to call their restaurant hotline number and the wait is 20+ minutes.\n\nOn Friday, March 4, 2010, our party of 9 arrived around 7:15 PM. As we were escorted to our table, we couldn't help but notice the shape of our table. A round table was connected to a rectangular table which errr, resembled a male part. Don't know if it was intentional since I told them it was my male's friend's b-day party? Anyhow, it made for a good laugh. \n\nFOOD:\n*Lobster Bisque ($12.50): Rich, velvety smooth with generous chunks of sweet tender lobster equals YUMMYNESS! The only complaint is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Four of my friends also had the bisque and complained about the same thing.\n\n*16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52): One word...WOW! The bone-in ribeye, aged for 8 weeks was one the most flavorful steaks I've ever tasted! The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with nice charred crust and a pink center. You can tell that the marbling slowly melted and basted the meat during the cooking process producing a rich, amazingly tender, and savory cut of meat. Aside from the Kobe from Craftsteak, this is hands-down the best steak ever; and for the price point, you really can't go wrong. If there weren't anyone watching, I would have literally grabbed the ribeye by the bone and gone to town cave-man style--it was THAT good!\n\n*Creamed Spinach ($9): DELISH! The spinach was extremely fresh and maintained a vibrant green in the velvety and savory sauce. It was well-seasoned w/o being too salty and complemented the steak perfectly. \n\n*Creamed Corn Gratinee ($9): OMG good--it tasted like a mac & cheese made with corn. The creamed corn was sweet and tender and was topped with a panko breadcrumb crust which gave a nice crunch to the dish. It was an explosion of flavor and texture combos in your mouth...sweet, savory, buttery, and crunchy.\n\nSERVICE:\nImpeccable service, although a little pretentious at times. I guess you would expect nothing less from an upscale restaurant like Delmonico's. When it came down to serving our entrees, it was like a symphony as the waiters/waitresses served our dishes in-synch with one another to create a \"ta-daa\" moment.\n\nI would have given Delmonico's a 4.5 star rating, however, they allowed Freed's to deliver a b-day cake and didn't charge a slicing fee.\n\nAMBIANCE/DÉCOR: \nNormally steakhouses have a very \"dark\" ambiance. However, Delmonico's was the complete opposite. It was well-lit with Ivory walls and ceilings with accent cobblestone walls, crisp white linens and chestnut furniture created a very simple, yet elegant feel.\n\nI'm ALL about splurging when on vacation. Go big OR go home right? And, when you're in Vegas, you definitely have to go BIG--so, what are you waiting for? Go on and get your Bone-In Ribeye ON!",

We were a group of 12 or so girls, there for a bachelorette party, and they handled us efficiently and graciously.\n\nIt's a great place to go if you're up on poker and want to splurge on a big slice of meat!",

Yeah, well my experience was kinda lame...the attentive staff was fine, the prices were completely outrageous even for the strip, and our food was just kinda boring. I didn't think much of it to be honest.\n\nYou may be saying... \"Well moron, you ordered duck and fish at a steakhouse, what did you expect?\" I would then reply \"Hey, if it's on the menu, it should be held to the same standards as anything else!\". So There! :P\n\nIf I do want to pay too much for a really good steak, I know where to go...but y'know, I'm a local and that is rare.

His restaurant, Delmonico Steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.\n\nDelmonico Steakhouse was our big dinner out in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm Sunday reservation. I ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).\n\nAs a table, we shared the BBQ shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), Truffle and Parm Potato Chips (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.\n\nFor my entrée, I decided to get the Bone In Ribeye-the house specialty. It did not disappoint. It was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something I do very often). We split the creamed spinach and the creamed corn gratinee. The spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. \n\nWe ended our meal with Emeril's infamous Banana Cream Pie. Holy moly. Sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.\n\nOur waiter was extremely attentive. Service, overall, was phenomenal. When our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. Now that's service.\n\nIt goes without saying that this was pricey, even for Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. \n\nI highly recommend checking out Delmonico at least once.",

Shrimp the size of my thumb after I hit it with a hammer covered in a fantastic spicy cream sauce, steak that you could cut with a spoon, a portion of the most tender venison I've ever had, that was just as good when cold the next day (because I couldn't eat all of it), a martini that made it harder to walk out of there than the amount of food I ate, incredible desserts, and well, an espresso menu that involved such quality coffee I had no idea coffee that good existed.\n\nI don't eat at high caliber steakhouses on a weekly basis or anything, but I've been to a few, and it's not like DC has a shortage of them given the wealth there.

We started with drinks in the bar, which was fine.  Our table for seven was ready on time, which is always nice.  Unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what I've had in the past at Delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  My husband and I shared a salad for an appetizer.  We let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  Unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.  \n\nI love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  It was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  My mom ordered seared ahi tuna which was served completely cold.  The outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  My husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  When the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.  The server went back to the kitchen and they realized they made a mistake and brought out the other rib-eye, while using tongs to take the half from my husband's plate and added it to my brother's plate.  Rookie move, seriously.\n\nMy family doesn't eat a ton of cards, so for sides we ordered two servings of the mushrooms, broccoli, and corn for my niece.  The server kept pushing for us to order a starch, which we insisted we didn't want- very bizarre, it's not like we weren't running up a pretty hefty tab.\n\nIt was my mom's birthday and I really thought Delmonico's would come through with an excellent experience.  The food was okay overall, but I really can't say that this meal met my expectations or anyone at our tables' expectations.  I've been to many Emeril restaurants, maybe they went through a recent management change??  I don't know, I wish I could explain the extremely average experience.",

Very pretty.  \n\nAnyway, we were seated and given a very extensive wine list--some wines upward of $3000.  We opted for a glass of wine.

Tomato Bisque soup with a dollop of cream: OH MY GOODNESS. So creamy and absolutely delicious\n2. Filet of beef medallions: The juiciest and most tender pieces of beef you'll ever find topped with mushrooms & bread crumbs, apple bacon, parmesan cheese and a special home made sauce *insert tears of happiness* \n3. Delmonico's prime hamburger: Oh my oh my. Served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese and bacon and accompanied by a bed of fries... this burger is unlike your average joe one. It's hearty, juicy, tender and foodgasmic. Do yourselves a major favor and include this as one of your entrees. \n4.

Well, on my recent trip to the USA, I had Yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!\n\nVegas Elite Dennis T was my lunch companion when I was in town. Not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but I was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review\n\nDennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n\nI had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico\n\nI instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n\nThe restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n\nI had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n\nDennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad\n\nIt may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n\nDennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n\nIn an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this\n\nDennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the Strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights\n\nA friendship sealed.

There may be a wait if you have not made reservations so make sure to call ahead and reserve a corner table (for people watching of course). - Not for the food.\n\nThe service was great! If my review were only for the service this would be an easy 5 star rating. There are two main servers, plus water, and wine servers as well. I always love this added touch because it makes for better service. \n\nNow to the real rating. The FOOD (insert dramatic music in background).\n \nLet's just say the bill came out to roughly $300 and we were not the least bit impressed. \nThe only notable item was the wine which was delicious, very smooth, a quaint merlot to go well with our steaks.. \nThat was about it though.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were too globby,  the mushrooms were simply made in a butter sauce that tasted, well, tasted buttery. \nThere was no essence action and considering this steakhouse is a reflection of Emeril- I'm not impressed. Where's the flavor Emeri?!? \nMy steak was ordered medium - my steak came out well done and tough. There were no add ons to compliment the steak, perhaps a dry rub, a sauce maybe? I asked for lemon to zest my steak, considering I still had every intention of eating it  (Yes, hunger is real when you're in Vegas on the weekend).. but what disappointed me the most were the cocktail lemon wedges which I received from our server.. \nIt was more of an, \"Are you kidding me? Delmonico cannot afford to add simple cheesecloth, or a gauze socks around half lemons and here I am cashing out 300 bucks!?\"\n\nI try my best to give each business the best reflection possible, but in all fairness Delmonico greatly lagged. I have definitely had better steak, better sides, and most definitely better dessert elsewhere- most of all a steak that is served with proper sides of lemon!\n\nAlso, incase you do end up here please also skip the chocolate cake. The pistachio ice cream does not compliment this desert one bit. I'm still in awe of the ratings others have given this restaurant. The food is off, and in all fairness at the end of the day I cannot EAT the service. I prefer actual tangible, consumable, well dressed and cooked morsels of, yep you got it, FOOD. \n\nSorry Yelpers- but this restaurant is not worth a return. 2 Stars.",

The place is huge and the service is excellent.\n\nWe ordered the chateaubriand steak for two which was 18oz and they carved the steak and cooked it to perfection right on tableside. We also got the mashed potatoes along with creamy spinach for the sides but just the steak alone was so tasty you don't really bother with the sides even though we did. \n\nThe server was super professional and from start to finish they crushed it and made sure we enjoyed the dinner.\n\n5 stars all the way. This is the restaurant which deserves more as lots of places get the 5 star rating.

Out of the 6 people we had with us 5 were or are in the food industry. The man was an executive chef and the rest are fine dinning servers. Our servers kept them very happy. \n   The man and I shared the Cesar salad for two prepared table side. I had the Fillet Oscar style. It was honestly the best steak I had ever had. They were very generous with the crab and asparagus. The rest of our party dinned on rib eye, pork chop and the day's specials. It was all amazing. We finished off the meal with a banana creme pie. I don't really like banana cream. This was outstanding. Real sliced bananas with fresh creme, my god! \n   When the bill came were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was.

					"text": "I'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  Delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants. \n\nI tried the foie gras and octopus appetizers.  The octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  The foie gras was rich.  I followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\nThe disappointment occurred during the main course.  Three of the people in our party ordered the filet mignon.  Two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  I had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. My filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. I suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    Additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  There was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n\nFor a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, I hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. I can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  I have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones I tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse I have been to where that has been the case.",

Well, we got all dressed up (for us,lol) and arrived about a minute or two before or 530 pm reservation and were seated within a couple minutes. The ambiance was great! Just what I was hoping for on this special night. So we peruse the menu and I decided to get the bone in ribeye and my wife selected the bone in NY strip. Both of which were touted as dry aged. We also got the buttered broccoli and potatoes augrautin. \n It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out and were given 2 pieces of bread which were light and tasty. The servers waiting our table did an excellent job of keeping our water topped off. And when our food was ready a small army of servers marched up and placed everything almost simultaneously. They all were impeccably dressed and very attentive and polite. \n Well, now to the really disappointing part which is also the most important. The food. I'm a foodie. And in particular a steak connoisseur. This was in my opinion the worst dry aged steak I've ever had. Not even to mention at this price point. I've had better steaks at any number of chain restaurants. It came drenched in a marinade and was full of gristle. I honestly believe we were served a cheap choice or select cut instead of dry aged prime for which we paid. The sides were OK. But the steaks were bad. And when shelling out over $150 for it needs to be an amazing meal. Do I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. And the only reason I didn't make a scene over the poor quality of our steaks was I was try desperately to salvage our special dinner. \n Emiril, step up the quality control!",

the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\n\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie's Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city's best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\n\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril's famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.",

Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \n\nMy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and I can't remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn't come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \n\nWe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \n\nFor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.

Therefore, it was a logical imperative that we check out Delmonico Steakhouse and its vaunted whiskey collection.  We got there around 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was largely empty as the restaurant was nearing the end of its service for the night.  As a side mission, we wanted to also check out the much-mentioned \"secret\" menu of whiskey-based cocktails created and crafted by Delmonico's lead barman, Max Solano.  Max possesses encyclopedic knowledge of whiskey and is personable and passionate about what he does and if he isn't busy, is very willing to impart some of his knowledge discussing the finer points of whiskey and his whiskey program.  As the curator of Delmonico's whiskey collection, he's assembled the most comprehensive lineup of whiskeys I've ever seen to include hundreds of ultra high quality, hard to find, or never heard of before brands from around the world.  As a personal aside, did they have Pappy Van Winkle?  Yes, of course,...the ENTIRE frickin' Pappy product line and it was on the shelf, not out of stock like so many other places that have it listed on their menu!  I was so tempted to get the Pappy whiskey flight, but on this visit, I was even more intrigued by the secret menu of cocktails.  \n\nDelmonico has a standard (but very intriguing looking) cocktail menu consisting of classics and originals that all of the bartenders can prepare.  However, only Max knows how to craft the secret menu cocktails.  I had the Don's Orders made with Templeton Rye and the Smoked Bluff made with Glenmorangie 12 yr. and both were complex, boozy with subtle sweetness, yet completely balanced.  Simply put, Max's secret menu cocktails were hands down the best treatment of whiskey in a cocktail form that I've yet consumed.  If you love whiskey, then the Delmonico Steakhouse is a must!

					"text": "My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.",

I wanted so much to love this place, to crown it, (it wasn't what I thought it was!), to walk out wholly satisfied in the knowledge that I will not have a better steak.  Dining here was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of this Vegas trip, \"remember the time we ate at Delmonico's...\" type thing.  The 3 stars is my confession to myself, this place was not worth the price.\n\nI'm no lover of Cajun food, or spices or anything, and the only thing I know about Emeril is he says \"BAM!\" a lot and the character Elzar on Futurama is a direct parody of him.  I've got no urge to try any more of his food though.  We ate here the evening of the Final Four, had an early reservation and was seated promptly in a fairly quiet room.  Good corner location where we could look out at everything around us but not have people walk by us.  The decor was not of any note... \n\nWe started with the cocktail shrimp with crackers... very odd.  I've been eating a lot of shrimp lately, and there was nothing special about these.  The sauce was a bit spicier than others, so decent.  I pushed my girlfriend to try the kobe...  while I stuck with my old standby of NY.  The bread was nothing special as well.\n\nMy sides were pretty average... I enjoyed my girlfriend's fried scallops though.  The vegetables and potatoes are just complements to the meal though.  The kobe steak came all sliced up and ready to go... It wasn't the mind blowing experience with kobe that I hoped it would be.  I could see the disappointment on my gf's face as she chewed on it.  On the plus side, the kobe sirloin meal came with the sides so thats a few bucks saved.  And sadly, thats the plus side of it.  \n\nMy steak was of a fairly average size, maybe an inch thick, bone-in and perhaps 16 ounces.  I ordered it medium... which the waiter confirmed would be pink throughout.  I waver between medium-rare and medium.. usually if a steak is bone-in I go medium.  Unfortunately, my steak was overcooked.  It got to that bastard style known as medium-well.  I kept hoping as I got closer to the bone it would pinken up, but no such luck.  I ate it happily as it was still a good steak, but I just couldn't shake the disappointment.  The seasoning used on it was decent and had some spice to it but no charm to it.  Part way through my meal I attempted to knife-lift a portion for the gf to try, and wound up dropping it on the table cloth leaving a huge outline of meat.  We laughed about it and both expected our waiter to say something, anything about it as he brushed it with the crumb brush.  Sigh, no such warmth here.  Service was efficient and not quite friendly.  I guess high end steakhouses cater to clients that would rather not have their imperfections pointed out.  One look at me would suggest I'm not the typical client, but no joke came from either our waiter or the assistant waiter.  \n\nAfter we perused the desert menu, I settled on the banana cream pie.  This was the best banana cream pie I've ever had.  It was beautifully presented, had fresh bananas, and was not too sweet.  This was the favorite part of the meal for me.  I doubt I'll ever have a better banana cream pite,  but I'll keep looking.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal but not worth the price.  Meal was ~$200 for 2, no drinks, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I doubt I'll ever go back on my own wallet.",

Not greasy, not fatty and the shell was definitely soft. The citrusy salad compliments the dish. One of the best soft-shell crab versions I've had. We got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5\n\nFilet Mignon:\nSince I'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what I normally get. Some people may find it boring but I like my steak simple and lean. Very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. This piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5\n\nChateaubriand:\nThe second most tender and lean cut of meat. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5\n\nBone-In Ribeye:\nDry-aged prime with butter on top. Superb! 4/5\n\nFoie Gras:\nThis was a side item. Perfectly seared and mildly sweet. You don't really need to do much to make foie gras taste good. KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5\n\nMushrooms with Garlic:\nThis side was really good. I love mushrooms and garlic. The mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. They were deliciously garlicky. 5/5\n\nGrits:\nThis has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. I wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5\n\nCreme Brulee:\nI've been feeling tired of this dessert. I didn't find joy in eating this. Plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5\n\nDelmonico Coquetel:\nGin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. Their signature cocktail...but why? Our server was right, I should've not wasted my time on this. It was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. I took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5\n\nA Tale of Two Cities:\nCherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. This was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5\n\nAnother drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. Since I'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. We got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. Service was good.

Delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. I liked the simplicity. \n\nOur waiter and his team were very attentive. Water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. They were all very professional. \n\nThe meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. I began my meal with the Wilted Spinach and Frisee salad. It was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. The bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. The candied bacon was amazing. They perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. All of the flavors worked so well together. \n\nIt was hard to order something other than steak, but it was Thanksgiving so I had to have my traditional dinner. The Thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. The turkey was very moist and flavorful. The plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. Under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. A delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. There was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n\nMy husband and I split a Twice Baked Potato because you have to have potatoes on Thanksgiving. I'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. The potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n\nFor dessert I had the Pecan Pie and my husband had the Thanksgiving dessert special. My Pecan Pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. The crust was buttery and flaky. I don't like crust usually, but this was very good. There was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. My husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. This kind of fell flat. Nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n\nI can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items.",

Walking past it in the Venetian, you wouldn't believe it extends back to a full restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance is elegant, comfortable, but friendly.  The manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  The wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.\n\nWe had the truffle & parmesan potato chips, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips.\nFor our main courses, I ordered the filet mignon.  My date ordered the bone in ribeye with foie gras.  My steak was arguable the best steak I've ever had.  It was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  I had a bite of the ribeye with foie gras, which was just savory overload.\nFor dinner, we received a complimentary \"Happy Birthday\" sorbet with a candle in it.\n\nI had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.  I only gave 4 stars and not 5 because the other menu items (starters and sides) were very forgettable.  The steak however, was unforgettable. \n\nDate night seal of approval!",

My husband ordered the double-cut pork chop, the size of a dinosaur. It was supposed to be medium, but was charred and a bit over done. I ordered the sea bass, but asked the chef to prepare it like the snapper special. It was thin, overly salted, and overall just not good. I am not a fan of al dente rice. I'm sure the chef prepares entrees a certain way for a reason, this just missed the mark in so many ways for me, when I had such high expectations. The head server promptly replaced my meal with a medium rare filet, in about 60 seconds. The steak looked dry, besides the pat of butter atop, the plate was hot, making me think it had been under the food warmer for some time. There was a crusted char on the exterior and Cajun seasoning, which again in my opinion was too much, and too salty. I want to taste the steak at a steakhouse, not cover it. Of all of the options in Vegas, we could get a lot better tasting food with equivalent price and service elsewhere. We will not be returning.",

The pie isn't as creamy as the yummy banana cream pie from Jongewaard's, but I think that may be because the banana to pudding ratio favors the bananas.

So anyways on to the food review.  I ended up ordering the tuna/salmon tartare appetizer and the bone-in rib steak medium rare.  The Tuna and salmon both were very tasty but the portion was rather small.  For $18, I would expect a little bit more.  Now on to the reason why we dined here....my steak came out and it looked giant.  The overall taste of the meat was only decent at best.  I was really expecting a more flavorful piece of meat.  Maybe they forgot to season it or just didn't put enough of emeril's spice?  I could tell though the meat quality was very, very good.  They advertise wet-age steaks, but I much prefer dry-aged steaks.  Too bad my steak was only just okay and for $52 I didn't feel ripped off but more disappointed.

The wine we ordered was great, as I knew it would be, but it was not at the great price I thought it was. Nice surprise for us on the bill when it was 2.5x more! Technically, not their fault, but it feels like it wasn't an accident on their part. It was lunch; not like I already had been drinking!\n\nOnion soup was awesome! Get some, for real! Very dark roux, super flavorful cheese. We shared a steak which was not quite the size our bartender told us it would be (ounces aren't on the menu) but was prepared nicely. The steaks (all except Wagyu) are prepared cajun style, so expect a different flavor profile than your traditional steak. \n\nGood food, but the bar needs more energy (maybe a bit of music?) and a bit of tweaking with the bartender. Maybe an evening trip will do the place more justice.",

(i guess winning jackpot at the casino would round it off nicely, but thats a whole 'nother story :)\n\nanyway, so in my opinion, dont even bother with the filet mignon, that cut is way over rated, which fancy pants rich people have turned into this \"exclusive\" non weight bearing tender cut of bovine that the social elite should be eating.  while, all of the tenderness story is true, the flavor is all in the bone in ribeye.  this place uses usda prime aged cut, which is the best you can get.  and get it bone in, the bones give off more flavor in the cooking process.  another sign of a good steak house is if its served with butter, which not every place does, but i personally think makes the meat taste 10x better.\n\none other thing i did like about this place is their dinner rolls served to everyone at the beginning of your dinner.  ya ya, dinner rolls, so what.  well, it was actually fresh here.  freshly made, warm, with a little bit of salt on it.  its like being at an awesome steakhouse that has a pan del sal bakery in it!  all in all, it's great food, great service, good location, being in between the palazzo and venetian, thats all you need.  just make sure you bring money, cause this place is on the pricey side, but have no fear, you will get your money's worth!",

What keeps me coming back is the bone in rib steak, which is the house specialty. All the beef here is wet and dry aged and amazing. The bone in rib is huge, but you will want to eat every bite and gnaw on the one, although not entirely appropriate at a restaurant of this caliber. Be forewarned that if you order a steak, you get a steak, nothing else. All sides are ala carte and family style. I personally choose to avoid the sides and save the room for the amazing beef. \n\nThe wine selection here is superb. Whether you are looking for a bottle of the finest bordeaux or simply a great by the glass selection, they have it.\n\nFor desserts, you can't go wrong with chef emeril. Pecan pie, peanut butter pie, creme brûlée, and banana creme pie, all amazing. Go for the peanut butter pie, or the banana creme, if they are featured that day.\n\nThe service here is second to none.

We also ordered a side of broccoli to share and some au gratin potatoes. The broccoli at $9 was just horrifying. It's all the reasons that children don't want to eat their vegetables. I think it started with an awful product. The broccoli itself was not only lacking in freshness, it was limp and flavorless. It could not have been good broccoli to begin with. It seemed as if it was frozen and then heated up slightly as it was mushy. It was also underwhelming with seasoning of any sort. Surprising from a restaurant of this caliber. Why bother selling broccoli when it was so disgusting. The au gratin potatoes were good. These at least had salt and were not overly cheesy. I give them a B.\n\nAs for service, it was OK. I realize hard to do good service with large parties. I will tell you that even though the server made up for it in the end, there was a big problem. I ordered a side of foie gras. It appeared on the table in front of me and then at some point in the service, someone from the wait staff came over and took it away from me so quickly, I didn't even have a chance to ask about it. Perplexed, I asked our server. He apologized and tried to get a new order on my table asap and he took it off the bill.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the foie that came to me.

It seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n\nCaesar Salad - I was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the caesar salad.  It was prepared table side by our waiter.  It was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n\nBone-in Ribeye - Mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  My particular cut was very, very tender.  My gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  I had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  Hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nSides - We ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   The corn was very good.  It had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  The asparagus was pretty plain.  I had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\nDessert - We ordered the banana cream pie.  I have no idea why we chose it, but I'm glad we did.  I would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  Well, it was good.  Really good.  When it came out, I thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  We weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n\nOverall, the food was good.  I have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.

In short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  What sold us was the Chateaubriand for two.

There are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or baked potato. Oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic Caesar salad prepared at table side for 2 as well.  Desert? Yes please!  You can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.

However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.\n\nTo accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.\n\nThe ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.\n\nI will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.  The steak was lousy, the bathroom is lame and the service sucked for an establishment of this caliber.  Word to Emeril:  You need to work on this restaurant - BAM!!!",

					"text": "Hey everyone - first yelp review. And what better way to kick it off than with the wonderful Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian Hotel and Casino. This is my first Emeril's experience and it was a good one. \n\nDisclaimer: A fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it! \n\nI was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. The appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp with biscuit. The shrimp were easily the most tasty that I've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). I wish I had 2 or even three. The biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), It actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.\n\nFor my entree I had the filet mignon ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. I order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. In this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. This was easily the best steak I've ever had - and I'm a red meat fan. \n\nService was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and I was simply too full to try dessert. The rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The highlight of the evening may have been seeing Larry Flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. Apparently he's a regular.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by Emeril's Delmonico. You WON'T be disappointed.",

					"text": "So, after several years of not eating at an restaurant of Mr. Lagasse, I finally made it to Delmonico's.  Why might you ask?  Well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n\nThis was the third Emeril restaurant that I've eaten at.  I used to live in New Orleans and ate at his first restaurant, Emeril's, and his casual outpost, NOLA, several times.  The food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n\nDelmonico's continues that tradition.  The service is excellent.  At times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  Food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  And the decor is so understated and clean.  It really is a nice change from all of the typical Vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n\nBecause my girlfriend was so eager to try Emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (New Orleans style) and shrimp cocktail with remoulade sauce.  The lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  However, it wasn't on the menu and I really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  The waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the shrimp cocktail.  To drink, she ordered a glass of Loosen Bros.  \"Dr. L Estate\" Riesling and I ordered a glass of Laurent Perrier NV Champagne. \n\nThe Riesling was recommended by the Asst. Sommelier.  The waiter initially recommended an Australian white blend.  But to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  When I commented to the Sommelier that I thought the Australian white had Viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  As we talked more, he said the Riesling was a \"perfect match\" for the barbecued shrimp.  You know what?  It was.  My girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the Riesling with each bite.  She even raved - it was a perfect match.  And she also loved the remoulade.  The barbecued shrimp were cooked well, I noticed one of the shrimp I had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  The shrimp cocktail was great.  Cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  They were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n\nFrom there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY PERFECTLY MED-RARE TO MED.  It wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  The twice baked potato with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  The asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  We shared a half bottle of 2003 Pine Ridge Crimson Creek Merlot which was a good match for the steak.  It had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n\nDessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  Both were excellent.  The banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  She ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), I ordered a glass of 2003 Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n\nWas it inexpensive? Of course not.  It was quite expensive.  But for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than Gallagher's and probably the second best only to Bouchon of the restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas) and the best service I've had in Vegas (yes, better than Bouchon), it was worth it.  \n\nWhy 5 stars?  Because everything went right.  Was the service perfect? Almost.  Was the food perfect?  Almost.  Were the drinks perfect?  Almost.  Adding that all together with the right person I wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (Although I didn't ever finish my French Laundry review, that place IS nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  It is still to this day, the best eating experience I have ever had and I've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n\nNow if I could only remember the name of the Asst. Sommelier, I would give him a shout out here.  \n\nI am once again a fan of Emeril.  But please, no \"BAM.\"",

Even the sides that my fiance and I split: smashed potatos, and asparagus-- were top notch. It's too bad that such an awesome culinary experience had to be ruined by everything else.\n\nFirst off: the decor. VERY spare, with high ceilings. Kind of felt like I was eating in a fancied up gymnasium. The dining room was dark but the sparse spot lighting was harsh, taking away any sort of mellow ambiance they hoped to achieve.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we were seated, a party of 7 very loud middle aged men came into the restaurant and sat at the table next to us. My fiance and I only ordered salad and dinner, and soda to drink since we don't pay for booze in Vegas. ;) This OTHER table was ordering bottles of wine and appetizers out the wazoo, and the waitstaff took the cue to ignore us and focus on the table that certainly ensured a bigger tip.\n\nThis was a HUGE turnoff. We are very lowkey customers by nature -- no substitutions, no special requests -- I waited tables during my college years so I know what it's like to be on the other side of things. But to sit there for 10 minutes with empty plates and glasses in front of us while 4 or so staffmembers fell over each other at the adjacent table uncorking bottles, getting out appetizers... it was unacceptable. It made us feel like intruders with our lowly $130 bill.\n\nPLUS, they charged us for soda refills? at $2.00 a pop. If I'm paying $50 for a steak, don't charge me for a stupid refill of Diet Coke.\n\nThe meal itself was awesome, but with so many other options in Vegas to choose from, we probably won't be going back.

More texture from the spinach than usual with the perfect balance of cream. Asparagus had just the right texture too. How will I eat dessert?\n\nBanana Cream Pie, that's how. IT'S DIVINE! You must try it. Polly and Marie be damned. This tall towering pie can be shared 3 or 4 ways, but you must go vertical. Cut a slab, drag it through the caramel sauce, slather it with cream, and throw it on your plate. Don't leave here without a cross-section of all its layered goodness. Look how happy my friend Lauren P. from San Diego was when it came.\n\nComing back fo sho. Emeril, you kick ass. BAM!",

					"text": "This is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, bar none. You can always count on Emeril Lagasse to deliver on his good name. We were in town for my fiance's birthday, so I jumped at the chance to make a reservation at Delmonico. \n\nWe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation. We took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. Not enough time to rate the cocktail service. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app. \n\nOn to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n\nThe fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish. \n\nDue to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe... \n\nThe service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. All my expectations were met, and I highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime!",

We were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  We were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n\nThe service was impeccable.   They started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  All of us buddied up and ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Steak...which was plenty to go around.  Tasty, it sure was but I'd have to say, I've had better.  The garlic mushrooms, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  We were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  By dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n\nSince we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, Delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.

The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \"Emerel's Blend\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.",

					"text": "Delmonico's is an institution - but it's by no means a \"5-Star\" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn't the founder of the original Delmonico's of New Orleans.\n\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico's serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who've been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \"Commander's Palace\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \"Delmonico's\".    And that's a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten was at the New Orleans' Delmonico's... not the Vegas location.\n\nGOOD NEWS:  IT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\nBut I don't think you'll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it's all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\n\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\nHere's the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\n1) FLAVOR\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico's and I think Charlie Palmer's outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina's StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It's probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \n2) SERVICE\nIf you're looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it's hard to beat Delmonico's.  That's something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer's probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there's rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I've consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\n3) DÉCOR\nIt's darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I've noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I'm not sure this is really a big point.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\nDelmonico's, while it's lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\n\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\n\n-----------------\nINSIDER'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You'll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico's in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I've pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on 'immediate seating' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu's really has no such seating other than \"next table available\")",

The lobster bisque was just ok - I have had better in my town of 150,000 and it usually has sherry in it - not there.  There were nice chunks of lobster in it though.  We expected more from an Emeril restaurant and really didn't feel that it had a Louisiana flair, although apparently it specializes in steaks.

					"text": "This was my first trip to Vegas...ever.  I know, how can that be after 31 years of age and my love for everything naughty?  Nevertheless, I wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  After consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetian.\n\nFirst, I was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time I booked the trip).  It was so easy I would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  Second, because Mr. Vivi and I were killing it at the Blackjack table at the Mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  I apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  Note:  I don't know if this would fly on a busy Fri or Sat night.\n\nTo say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  We had our main server, I think his name was Eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned Blackjack table so his name could have been Bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  We also had two other people who were assisting Eric with the service who were great as well.  Eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  Our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.  \n\nI had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, I had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  We opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the Parmesan potato chips) and went straight to the Cesar salad served table side for two.  If you love Cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  They freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  When Eric was finished with my plate I could have clapped I was so happy...in fact I think I did. \n\nNext, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice baked potato.  Can I say I am in heaven??  This is why I could never be a vegetarian.  The meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  So tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  The asparagus and twice baked potato were both good, but I would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.  \n\nI knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  From start to finish the entire experience made me forget I left a table we were up 500 dollars.  \"Ah yeah babe,\" this place is that good and I will be back the next time I visit.",

That is how much we love this dish. It is very delicious. Any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.\n\nThe other entrée that we ordered was the lobster sliders. I did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. I personally do not like cold sandwiches and also I only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. The lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it.

Steak was cooked correctly, but thin (for a premium steakhouse) and presentation was poor -- cooled and congealed greasy sauce/butter.  I am skeptical of the USDA Prime rating for this steak -- it was nowhere near as high quality as other Prime steaks I've had.  Creamed spinach was oddly tough and chewy -- I don't even know how that is possible but it was.\n\nOn the plus side, the lighting is effective and the whisky and bourbon selection is great.\n\nService felt very scripted and impersonal.\n\nI can't believe the reputation this place has.  I guess it is Vegas, and when people pay top dollar they put on their rose tinted glasses and fail to see that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nIf it was not for the price and reputation, i would say it was a decent meal.

					"text": "The steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. The decor was very clean and contemporary. The hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nThe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared The beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. The booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\nI took my seat and I was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. I decided to go with their Filet Mignon and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. The chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. Classic jumbo shrimp cocktail, Parmesan truffle chips, classic Caesar salad, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nThe classic jumbo shrimp cocktail with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as I expected. The shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. The sauce was like eating a handful of Wasabi.\n\n The extremely addicting truffle Parmesan chips were EXCELLENT and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. The chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved Parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nThe classic Caesar salad had much to desire. The way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. It was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing Caesar dressing. I don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic Caesar salad just to be different. Don't mess with a good thing!\n\nThe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. The mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. The waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. The plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. Not a good sign of service. \n\nThe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the Filet was ammmmazing. The steak knife cut through the Filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some New Orleans style spices. I truly enjoyed the Filet till the very last bite. One thing I do have to mention is the dessert. I would highly recommend the famous Emeril's banana cake. This thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. I could not even describe it in words if I even tried so I won't! So you will have to try it for yourself. \n\nOverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best I have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. My favorite parts were the Filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the truffle chips, mmm! delicious! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. I was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. That can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience I'd say that was definitely worth it! Many thanks for reading. Till next time.",

					"text": "Great steak but disappointing service for the price.  Went here for a friend's bachelor party.  We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.",

When it comes to purses, shoes and sometimes clothes, I'll put down a pretty penny or hundred for nice stuff. But when it comes to food, I think to myself, \"Is it really worth the cost to put something in only to have it come out?\" \n\nIn this case, \"Yes!\" Okay... Sort of... \n\nI ordered the boneless Ribeye and a side of broccoli. Ribeye was good - just enough flavor and not too salty. Being the carnivore that I am, I was shocked that I really enjoyed the broccoli too. It was as perfect as steamed vegetables could get. It was bright green from top to bottom and crispy, not mushy. \n\nMy sister had pasta with shrimp. I must say, though there was shrimp on her plate, they were not \"shrimp\" at all! They were huge!! Seriously, Delmonico must get their produce, seafood and meat from \"Food Heaven R Us\" or something. \n\nAlthough the food was good, I would say the service is what gives Delmonico 4-stars. Again, I'm not a frequent fine diner. So, to have my water glass filled up every time it gets low to having another (delicious) roll magically appear on my plate just as I suck in the last mouthful is fantastic! I'd even go so far as to say they'd probably spray the air around me with something fragrant once the broccoli hit you know where. \n\nNow I can see why it's worth it to pay at least $50 for dinner.

					"text": "My family went here for Fathers Day at noon. The place had a very nice atmosphere. We sat two minutes after checking in.  Five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. He introduced himself and another waitress. We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, \"Yes\".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.  This took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  Sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  Mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. Very very poor start of customer service.  I would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  Another, I had black slacks on. I placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  I went to other restaurants in Vegas and I was offered a black napkin to use instead.  Others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  The restroom was located all the way in the very back.  I thought I had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  You have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  The sink was shallow and I could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  There was only one sink available.  Food would have been excellent.  Service was mediocre.  I'm not sure I would return here if I have this kind of service.  It was my first time here.",

I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just \"OK\". My breakdown of each dish is this:\n\nThe Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).\n\nAppetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.\n\nCreamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.\n\nTwice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.\n\nRibeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Béarnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Béarnaise WAS THE BOMB!\n\nSmoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty. \n\nPecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.\n\nAs previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the \"upcharge\" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! Outside of opening the bottle and pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?\n\nNeedless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.",

There really is no cheap thing to eat here, other then the sides that went for $9 a pop.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed.  The service is good.  They paid attention to the little things that mattered like re-filling up your water when your cup is empty, and coming back every 10 minutes or so to ask if you need anything else.  Be prepared to bring a chunk of change with ya...steaks costs anywhere from $50 to $60 depending on how you want it prepped or what kind of steak you want.

The ambiance is nice and the service is good, as any high-class restaurant should be but the steak was sub-par. I've been to many steakhouses in my day, and let me tell you; the steak was just not good. We started off the night with some appetizers and drinks that were delicious. We ordered the lobster claws and tuna tarter, which was actually pretty good. Then we got to the steak. I have to admit, I was excited because Delmonico's is known for their steak, and I am a man who loves his red meat. \n\nThe first cut was rough and filled with cartilage / fat. It was very difficult to cut through, and I had to discard it because there was hardly any meat on it, more so just fat. After two or three bites, I started to accept my fate. I had a bad cut. The meat was underseasoned and not as juicy as medium rare should be. I thought maybe the meat was on the last days of expiration or something, but all in all, it just wasn't good. At places wehere I'm spending more than 60 bucks on a ribeye, I eat everything. I mean everything, the fat, the cartilage EVEYTHING. Because it's usually that good. At Delmonico's, I left half the plate. My advice, save your money for a better steakhouse. This one is overrated.",

The itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\nI had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nThe protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nAs for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nYou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.\n\nOn the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.

Our sides were delectable!! Creamed corn and potatoes gratin accompanied the steaks perfectly. Honestly, the only thing lacking in my opinion was the overly simple décor! Other than that I'd return in a heartbeat!",

I think we got lucky since it was only 6ish but I recommend making reservations, especially as it was packed when we walked out by 7:30.\n\nOur waiter was incredibly helpful as we sorted through the menu and wine items. I ended up getting the porkchop while my friend got the bone-in ribeye. We also shared the cream corn and garlic smashed potatoes. Our food was served quickly and the red wines we ordered were fantastic - the Tobin James was darker than I usually like it but rich and paired very well with the ribeye. My Meiomi was a bit lighter and fruitier but was a great recommendation for its price.\n\nBe prepared for a BIG meal, the slabs of meat are huge and we barely got through half of our sides. So come hungry! Both the porkchop and ribeye were delicious - flavorful, tender, and juicy. Several waiters came by to check on us which was appreciated.\n\nThe only reason I'm docking a star is for the decor - a bit plain and out of the 90s. Lighting is perfectly dim but hopefully they renovate to match the prices. To be clear though, this is not a reason to not come - the dinner will be worth it!",

The head waiter gave us great recommendations on what steak to select, and which wine would go well with it. I was amazed at all of the little details including refolding my table cloth while I was away at the restroom.\n\nThe food was 5/5 - all of us ordered a medium-rare bone-in ribeye. It was the biggest and juiciest steak I've ever had. Quite unfortunate that I was not able to finish the last third, the serving was that large. Yes, the check for 4 people ended up being several hundred dollars but it was worth every single cent for the dining experience.",

Food highlights: free popovers, lobster bisque. \n\n* Popovers - 5 stars: The BEST, small, light, airy, chewy, you could almost stuff the entire thing in your mouth. I've had good popovers at NM, but like the texture and size of these more. AND they give you a huge plate of softened salted butter - WINNER.\n* Lobster Bisque - 4.5 stars: One of the better lobster bisque's I've had! Great overall flavor, rich and decadent.\n* Side of mushrooms, creamed corn, fingerling potatoes - 3.5 stars: All of these were good. 3 kinds of mushrooms cooked generously in butter, my favorite. Followed by the creamed corn, very different with a strong jalapeno flavor. Fingerling potatoes standard.\n* Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: Emerill's famous banana cream pie is huge - stacked high with chunks of fresh banana. The cream needed more banana flavor, seemed overwhipped, and the crust could've been more buttery. Was still good though.\n* Key Lime Pie - 3.5 stars: Really good key lime pie on an excellent crust, a little too sweet for me though.\n* German chocolate cake - 2 stars: Cake tasted airy, reminded me of box cake. Prefer Duncan Hines (sorry!).\n* Chateaubriand - 2.5 stars: Had an incredibly tender well-seasoned Tomahawk at Beauty and Essex, and in close second was Carnevino's. The Chateaubriand is a hunk of meat for two, sliced and cooked tableside. The meat was tender, but the texture kind of reminded me of a pot roast (not a fan), and it had a bit of a weird, gamey flavor....Recommend sticking with the ribeye.",

The filet I had at Outback was much more tender. \n*Grits w/bacon and white cheddar: If you like steel cut oats, you'll like this, which I do.  Not creamy like most grits.  Has texture.\n*Banana cream pie: OMG... I LOVE banana cream pie, but this was really bad.  The cream was sooo thick it was almost like a dense cake.  It looks impressive because of the layers of banana.  The flavor wasn't there. Safeways' banana cream pie is MUCH BETTER!! \n\nI also had a cocktail and a glass of red wine.

Sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n\nI made reservations via Yelp/OpenTable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first \"just us\" trip to Las Vegas.\n\nIt was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. When we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. I then asked them to take her coat and they responded that Delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. Strike one.\n\nThe hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. That was a small, but nice touch.\n\nI had expected Delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. I almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but I understand it is Vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. But it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n\nThe waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (Renee, I believe it was). I had to ask for the wine list. Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.\n\nRenee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n\nThe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n\nThis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that I had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\n\nOur food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. We had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. She had the lobster bisque which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. I had the duck prosciutto flatbread. The duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n\nAlmost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n\nShe ordered the filet and I had the bone-in rib-eye. Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n\nThe sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.\n\nThe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. We finished dinner within 1 hour. Strike three.\n\nTotal damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. We've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. It's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.\n\nThere are many better options available in Vegas.",

Although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the filet mignon just for its AMAZING tenderness. I'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all I will say is this: perfection. And you HAVE to pair the steaks with the house red wine. It transformed our meal even more.\n\nAnd for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and I wanted to cry. That honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. I took one bite, and wanted to cry. \"It was the best tasting dessert I had ever had in my life\" is an understatement.\n\nFinally, I loved the look of the restaurant.

My boyfriend and I ordered up a couple of cold beers, Truffled Parmesan Chips and Lobster Sliders to share. OH EM GEE!!  The Sliders were amazing! Nicely toasted roll filled with a creamy, perfectly seasoned lobster salad. No skimping on the lobster either. Nice, tender chunks and crisp pieces of celery for added crunch. Delish! The chips... We'll, we ordered another batch.. They were THAT good!  Crisp, crunchy, chips drizzled with truffle oil for that earthy yumminess and sprinkled with some tangy grated Parmesan. At halftime, we followed up with the Grilled Ricotta and Tomato Soup. Fantastic! Thick layer of creamy Ricotta and Basil between slices of buttered grilled toast. Not sure if the soup was intended for dipping but that's what we did! The soup was light and tangy -perfect for taking our ricotta sandwich for a dip!!

Truth to be told, I was little envy, but was also very excited to finally get to go here after missing out two years ago.\n\nI'm not really big on name of a chef nor do I care about so much about the branding of the place. Here's the funny thing.... I was excited in going to Dan Marino's place only because it was in HOOTERS. \n\nSee, it really doesn't amount to much.\n\nMy dining companion and I made a lunchtime reservation after realizing we couldn't squeezed all the places we wanted to go on this trip. We had already set up a reservation for dinner at Bouchon (at the same hotel at the Venetian) later on the night, so we compromised and reserved a table for Delmonico's for lunch.\n\nIt was an adventure finding place along the restaurant row. We had a harder time finding Bouchon later on the evening, but to get it out the way....this place is next to Aquaknox and the entrance is all the way towards the end of the hall.\n\nThe place was specular. Very classy and refine by the elegance of the look to the place. it's a bit more than what I expected for a fine dining. I guess I was assuming steakhouse in the form of Morton's, but this place outdone itself by making it more classier and upscale than any of the Morton's.\n\nFor lunch, it was casual. Not dressy as it was listed in the profile.\n\nThe lunch menu was very limited. I was almost going to be sorely disappointed because the menu's best item was dry beef sirloin. However my mood was lifted when the waitress presented us with steak menu that normally is on the dinner, but will be serve at lunch as well. \n\nThat was a big relief because I did not want to get stuck with dry aged beef. I proceeded to order Filet Mignon for myself while my partner in crime decided to take one of their special. \n\nThe coolest thing I saw on the menu was a Truffle Parmesan Potato Chip for appetizer. It was a great start to a great meal because I just couldn't get enough of that chip. What amazed me even more was the fact that it was a seasoned POTATO CHIP. Who else would be insane enough to order that for appetizer for $9?\n\nYeah...us!\n\nWe have gotten great service throughout our meal and gotten constant check up from the staff. Anywhere from our wait staff to refill our water and house baked bread (which included the butter with a shade of letter \"D\") to the chef who came to make sure that the steak was to my liking after changing for the better.\n\nI had ordered it Medium Well, the chef changed it to Medium/Medium rare because the meat was excellent cut that day and I guessed he didn't want to overcook the meat to lose the flavor. Honestly, that was a good decision on his part because the steak was that good. I savored every bite and the meat didn't drip of blood. That would have been too much, but luckily it wasn't.\n\nThe other thing I highly recommend to get was their creme of corn and lobster soup. That was rich in texture, very creamy without being too diluted. That soup itself would make a great meal if they decided to offer it in the menu as a large bowl. The soup was that good.\n\nFor $70, that was a fine meal and I have no regret. Even though the slot machines that was not far away was calling me all day.\n\nOur table was part of the wine tasting lounge. They have a few table that has an open window wall that overlooked the mall of restaurants. it makes it a nice people watching opportunity that scenesters would love. The bar and the lounge sofas are a bit high class for a normal wine tasters, but for the quiet soothing atmosphere this place presents, these things goes very well in that room.\n\nThere is a bigger dining room, but I think dinner would filled it up more. I suggest getting the table there next to the window so that people can watch you eat with jealousy....just kidding!\n\nTo my amazement, I didn't utter the famous catchphrase \"Bam!\" I might as well since I had a wonderful meal with steak that was cooked just right. if it was a romantic dinner, I would have gave it an awesome \"Bam!\" \n\nI would definitely try to make it back here again next time when I'm in Vegas.\n--------------------\nQuality: *****\nDecor: *****\nService:****\nAmenity: ****\nAmbiance: *****",

We loved the blt dish.\n\nNext we got lobster deviled eggs and tomato burrata salad. Both were sooo good!\n\nMy husband got the wagu ribeye and enjoyed it. I got the petite filet and it was delicious. They brought my husband a passion fruit sorbet with a candle on top for his birthday.\n\nThe only negative that I can give our dining experience was that we were next to 3 different tables that were drinking. So it got very loud several times. That's why I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5.",

I had the chopped salad for lunch, which was huge and had lot of everything in it.  I'm not sure if there is a separate lunch menu from the dinner menu, but I did find out bill quite pricey considering it was for lunch and no one had a steak!",

Then came our dinner server who was borderline rude. \"Are your seafood options listed here the only meat-free options you have? Most of them have sausage or some sort of meat in them,\" I inquired. \"Yep,\" was all he said before moving on... didn't even offer to remove an ingredient or help me out in any way.\n\nThe food was pretty tasteless. An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer's market for a fraction of the price. And it's not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you're going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it's not worth it.\n\nIf you're wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.",

There were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new Build A Bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! How cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, shrimp cocktail should be named prawn cocktail, and the squash ravioli - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. Every time I see lobster bisque, I order it for the kids, they LOVE it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. Hubby had the ribeye steak, I had the filet mignon, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and colorado rack of lamb. I think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. Very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! We shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. The pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. Again, expensive, but money well spent. Will come back again for sure!",

And most hotels in Vegas do not have a fridge or microwave in the room.  So, I couldn't take it with me.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding with butter pecan ice cream, chocolate cake, and pecan pie.  And these were not your typical \"pecan pie\" or \"chocolate cake\".

I wanted to put that potato hash in my pocket and take it home!. I would highly recommend this for anyone coming in and if my review were only based on this then I would give it a five star!  Unfortunately it's not...The other four people in our party decided to order steaks and all of them disliked them...I am from Texas so I never make the mistake of ordering a steak outside of Texas because I am almost always let down.  Our server was mean and did not do her job well. She seemed that it was almost more of an annoyance when we wanted to order anything!  I hate to say it but come on, You're in Vegas as a high end server....The wait time in between drink orders seemed extremely longer than normal and when the manager finally came over to address the steaks, he did nothing....Even though my food was perfect the whole experience was just off-putting and The Decour of the restaurant needs a major overhaul. Bland and boring....I also found it very unprofessional that they had about 15 chairs stacked in the hallway between the restaurant on your way to the bathroom....anyway I hate giving this restaurant only two stars but I want everybody to know...",

I should have said its more of a matured restaurant.  The spot is elegant and classy. From the hostess to the waitress, this spot screams fancy.  We had a lovely dinner here during our Vegas trip.   Before dinner we grabbed a few drinks.  They were really solid.  I guess in Vegas I can be a bit more loose.\n\nLocated inside the Venetian, it was actually my second time visiting this hotel.  Its an incredible spot. I love everything about it.  We were seated and given a menu.  After about a few minutes were decided to run with the bone in ribeye.  Boy was I in for a treat, tasty treat.  The meat was super juicy.  The juices flowed through with every bite.  Cooked to perfection, this piece of steak is highly recommended in my books.   To be honest, when it arrived I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to finish it but after several bites, I kept at it, wanting more.  \n\nOverall this was actually one of my favorite restaurants.  I caught a glimpse of this spot a few years back and had been wanting to give it a try ever since.  Finally I was able to and it was worth it.  The bone in ribeye is definitely my favorite for about 55 bucks.  The filet was solid too I'm told by my counterpart, but no regrets on my end.  We had a lovely time.

Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.\n\nThe important thing - the steak.

One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I'm paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don't get me wrong, you'll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money's worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).

We also had the Jumbo Australian Lobster tail that was sweet and cooked to perfection in a white wine reduction with aromatic veggies/herbs($95).May I also suggest the Bone In Ribeye($55) which is the house specialty....it's to die for !!!!  In regards to attire it seems like a dressy place but folks were showing up with Tommy Bahama Shirts,Shorts and flip flops and were seated without question and some were \"dudded up\". My wife and I ate for about $200 but it was worth every penny !This a must stop for a special dinner if your a steak lover !!!!   Oh....our table as well as everyone else's had four servers and a host !!!! Exemplary Service",

I had the Salmon special and it was great as their fish dishes always are.  Until last week I was never a fan of Key Lime pie- but when we got several desserts for the table the Key Lime pie was one of them.. and although I went in with hesitation... it was hands down the best dessert on the table...so the new rule for me is Key Lime Pie- but only at Delmonico!  As all things with the Emeril name impeccable service was our experience - even with a trade show crowd and a large private whiskey tasting event. Our water glasses were never less than 2/3 full, a server was always there for another drink or any issue. The pace of our meal was first rate. I'll be back again next year!",

Since we had 10, they had to put us on two separate tables, which was ok, because they were right next to each other anyway.\n\nDecor:  nothing spectacular.  i thought it was alittle too dim for me.  I like a well lit restaurant for the purpose of really getting to see the different colors of your food and wine.  You can tell a lot about your food by it's color...it's freshness, it's doneness, etc.\n\nFood:  Very good.  I had the filet and it was super tender.  My buddies ordered the bone in rib-eye and almost all said it was amongst the best steaks they ever had.  Everything is a la carte so we shared sides of grilled asparagus (good), garlic smashed potatoes (yummy), sauteed wild mushrooms (yummy), and caesar salad (good).\n\nService:  Very good also.  Our waiter was very polite even when our rowdy half drunk group couldn't decide on what to order.  He was very helpful with the wine and picked out a nice bottle of merlot that worked with our budget.  Server's were very fast and attentive.  They made sure everything was perfect...which pretty much was.\n\nPrice:  Pretty fair and expected of a high end steak house.  bone in 20 oz. rib-eye was about $50 and my 12 oz. filet was around $45.  Sides were around $8-12, and one order feeds 2 people.  Yes, they have an extensive wine list and Yes, they have seafood also.\n\nOne last important note:  there isn't a smoking/non-smoking section, so people with kids, and non-smokers beware.",

And I had all three tonight. \n\nI generally bring a couple of bottles of wine from my collection to share with Dillon, the sommelier. This time I brought a 2004 Rubicon 100% Cab Franc and a 1999 Grgich Hill Cabernet. Holy shit the Cabernet was AbFab!!! Perfect in every way. \n\nTo start, we had something special from Chef. Then we moved on to the Foie Gras and Oysters. Both Anna and I were trying to play nice and say, \"Here, you take the last bite.\", but deep down we wanted it all to ourselves!!! Next we ordered the Chateaubriand. All the steaks are exceptional, but there's something about this. I think cause it's French. I love everything French. Perfect in every way. Grilled right in front of you to a Medium Rare perfection. This was also accompanied with asparagus and mashed potatoes (I had them add some truffles to the mashers. Well it is my birthday!!!). And for dessert, the birthday ice cream and two shots of Jäger. They actually don't have Jäger at the restaurant, so they had to go out and find some for me. That's why I love this place.

They served us a complimentary tomato mousse on a puff pastry to start and for being a single bite, it was packed full of flavor! I knew we were in for a treat. Ordered steak tartare for an appetizer and fell in love. It comes with an egg yolk over the top which gives it a wonderful velvety taste. Decent portion although I could have eaten much more. Next we shared the tomato and burrata salad. The burrata was the best I've had....so creamy and rich. Delicious! For our entree, we shared the Chateaubriand. Holy crap was it amazing! The first bite literally melted in my mouth. It's served with asparagus which was super fresh and crisp. We substituted fingerling potatoes for the mashed potatoes and were very happy with our decision. We also added foie gras, which was delicious. I seriously could eat the steak ever day though.... It's one of the best I've ever had. For dessert, we were interested in the bread pudding but went with the suggestion of 2 different servers and ordered the pecan pie. Holy shit it was incredible. Not your typical pecan pie....it's made with oats and love and magic. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. We come to Vegas and splurge on a nice dinner once a year, typically going somewhere new each time, but there's a chance we'll make a repeat visit next year.

Clean and well-kept. \n\nService: The service was generally pretty good from the two support staff assisting our primary server. Our main server, however, was quite underwhelming to say the least. It was apparent from the moment he greeted us that he wasn't enthused to have a 2 top sit down (at a table for 2 no less). I mentioned to the server that I was interested in an appetizer to share, but didn't want something so large as to prevent me from fully enjoying the steak I had decided on. He ignored my question for a suggestion. I've never had that happen, anywhere, let alone a fine-dining establishment. The worst part, however, came to the bill. To set the stage, we were seated adjacent to two other 2-top tables, one of which was behind us in the meal progression, the other who was ahead of us. Several moments after our dessert and after dinner-drinks were dropped off, our bill was placed on our table with the statement \"I'll take this as soon as you are ready.\" Interesting . . . I looked at the table next to us, who had already finished dessert and they did not have their bill yet. And on top of that, he failed to ask us if we wanted anything else, which had he asked, he would have realized that my wife would have liked more hot water for her tea. My wife was also thoroughly irritated with the fact that the bill was explicitly placed within my reach, and not hers. She made it a point to the server that she was the one who wished to pay.\n\nFood: We were both completely and 100% underwhelmed with everything we ordered. I had the \"house special\" which was a dry aged, bone-in ribeye, reportedly seasoned with Emril's Essence. It was a good steak. Not great by any means, and most certainly not worth the $52 price tag. The flavor was mediocre (surprising since its purportedly dry-aged), and the cook highly inconsistent. It was ordered medium rare, and parts were rare, others were medium. Very disappointing and suggestive of an amateur grill chef. I'm quite content to pay that much and far more for a good steak, however, I expect to get what I pay for, and this was most certainly not it. I've had far superior steaks for less than 1/2 that price.  My wife ordered the snapper, and it was so overcooked that it was mostly inedible. Also had the mushroom side, which was generally pretty good.\n\nThe dessert, however, was quite good. The banana creme pie.\n\nPerhaps we went on an off night, however, this experience coupled with the abundance of other restaurants on the strip, is enough for me to never return.",

					"text": "Superb!\n\nI'm sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn't come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Ermiril's show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he's not the one cooking my meal, then it's not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that's for sure.\n\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio's buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you're saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\n\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn't stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet's looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn't a proper meal we would've gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \"Generous Cut\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\n\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I've ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\n\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They're one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\n\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\n\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.",

All agreed and so we booked a reserv. for Delmonico. \n\nThe decor was simple, but elegant... kinda mod, imho. Looked very exclusive from the outside, so I felt all fancy. :D\n\nI have to give MAJOR props to the waiters(s), especially an awesome young gentleman who was a total sweetheart (I think his name was Andre..). Actually, I was shellshocked at the great service... most pricey restaurants are pretty snooty, but the peeps @ Delmonico were warm and super attentive.\n\nUnfortunately, there was major drama @ my table with a couple of the girls (snide remarks,  tears, running to the bathrooms), throughout which Andre (?) remained patient. I tuned all this out because................................\n\n..... I WAS HAVING MINI MOMENTS OVER MY AMAZING, TENDER, SUCCULENT AND DELICIOUS BONE-IN RIBEYE!!!  holy mother. The thing was huge and ex-roomie and I actually shared it (with Andre sweetly saying that it was not a problem) and it was STILL too much. Had my steak been anything but spectacular, I would have been mortified at the shenanigans. Instead, I swiped some artichoke spears (crisp, fresh and awesome) & truffle potato chips (a little greasy but OMG, so good)  from the other ladies and dug into the side we ordered, which was the potato au gratin (again, a little heavy but OHHH... so amazingly tasty... my favorite side dish!) \n\nCrazy delicious food, beautiful ambiance and wonderful service, and actually, with the magic of sharing, did not break the bank. I will definitely be back!!!!!",

					"text": "I seem to have really good luck with Emeril's restaurants. After my recent visit to Delmonico's, I'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. From the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. We were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nThe atmosphere inside Delmonico's is not at all what I would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. The colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, I need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nWe started with some truffle potato chips and a tomato salad to share while we were getting settled. Vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. Ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with Chambolle Musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of Sancerre to start. \n\nI ended up getting Emeril's famous bone-in ribeye, Vince got the filet, and Phil and Alexandra got BBQ shrimp and mushroom medallions. We also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic smashed potatoes. For someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. Cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of Emeril's Essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. Vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. I was impressed with Alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. I'd had the shrimp before at Emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. The spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\nI finished up with some pecan pie, a generous Jamaica Blue Mountain espresso (I was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. Too bad it was only lunch! This meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (In addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). Afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. Next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. I already can't wait!",

					"text": "As Vegas steakhouses go, Delmonico is a fine choice. I've been there twice and both times I've had very good meals. With that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit I'm afraid Delmonico should have been even better. This year we had a large company dinner at Delmonico, so I was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp and the butternut squash ravioli. The shrimp was good but a little overcooked. The squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. I loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  I also tried the truffle potato chips, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nThe lobster bisque was textbook, exactly what lobster bisque is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. Still I might have preferred my neighbor's heirloom tomato salad, which I tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  I didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nFor my entrée I had the Delmonico signature steak - a bone-in ribeye. This is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. The steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. My order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and I thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks I've had in Las Vegas, at all price points. One of my close work friends who has frequented Delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. Of the sides I loved the creamed corn. Next time I'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which I found undercooked and under seasoned. The asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nThe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but I'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. Best bite of the night. One of the best I've had. Wonderful.",

The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. \nThe service and customer service here is exceptional. \n\nWe tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake. \nMost of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again. \nThe filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. \n\nWhen asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work.",

If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \"let somebody know\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.",

I chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value. \n\nOrdered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red. \n\nThe service was excellent for the entire meal. The table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like Yorkshire pudding. The house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what I ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good. \n\nWas served quickly, if I had clients with me I would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated. \n\nThe asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. The ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. The waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, I decided on the filet. I was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. Also served fresh asparagus. \n\nDessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. Both very good. The pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. The crust was very favorable and went well with the Carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream. \n\nOther notes, good lighting and I liked the architectural ceiling. Chairs are stylist and very comfortable. I recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. Never like sitting near restroom entrance, which I was; as much as I like most people watching I would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. Lastly white sugar cubes, really?",

Definitely, definitely worth it.\nFirst off, if you're stopping in, I would recommend making reservations beforehand, as it can get quite busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Love the fact that it's in the Venetian, as that's usually my go to hotel in Vegas, and very easy to get to from the Casino floor.\nVery casual atmosphere, but very upscale service. Our server was fantastic, and we were well taken care of from the moment we stepped in. First class all the way.\nThe food was everything I was hoping for and more. Had calimari for an appetizer- delicious. The bread that came with the meals- delicious. Decided on the filet mignon for main course, with sides of creamed corn and cheese grits. Spectacular. The filet mignon was the best steak I've ever had, bar none. Cooked PERFECTLY, it just melted in my mouth, and you couple that with the creamed corn, which seriously could be the best vegetable I've ever eaten, and holy smokes, you've got yourself a classic meal. \nSince it was my birthday, I decided on the root beer float for desert. Awesome. It was a New Orleans root beer served with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was awesome. Just awesome. Plus side- the servers hooked me up with a free chocolate cake type desert because it was my special day! I felt so loved!\nOverall, I LOVE Delmonico. The prices are a lot more than you'd pay for an outback or longhorn, but that should be a given. The service was spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, and the food out of this world.

Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nService: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.

					"text": "LAS VEGAS...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original \"dreamgirls\" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and barbecue shrimp as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered pork chop, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a filet mignon.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and roasted fingerling potatoes.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my \"peak\" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.",

It was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nWe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nOur cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend's fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \n\nThe sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n\nMy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!",

					"text": "My first review on yelp. Only reason I'm doing this review is because of Delmonico's Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \n\nFirst came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,\"Damn I'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks\" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \n\nThen came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.",

They bring one at a time but it's unlimited. The butter comes on a design on a small plate.\n\nOur drinks were tasty, came quickly.\n\nFor an appetizer we got the king crab deviled eggs. They were good... nothing too special honestly.\n\nEntrees were the rib eye and filet and shareable sides were the mushrooms and gratin potatoes. Steaks were cooked to perfection, mushrooms were amazing. Potatoes tasted like plain scalloped potatoes, could've used more seasoning and cheese.\n\nDessert was pecan pie with caramel and vanilla ice cream.. amazing. \n\nThe service was great, our waters were never once empty, plates always cleared and food came out quickly.\n\nOver all it was a great date and experience.

Not worth ordering again in the future. I had to of course order the bone-in ribeye for my entree. It's disappointing to me when a steakhouse doesn't cook a steak the way you had requested... especially a high end one such as this. I ordered medium-rare. It was definitely cooked medium. I don't usually send food back because other people are with me and I'd have to make them wait. I can still enjoy my food if it's not perfect. However, I do make a note of it on my reviews so that the chefs and future customers know. I'm sure this isn't a mistake that they make regularly (At least I hope not!). I also prefer a saltier steak. It could have used more fat too. I like my hypertension and cholesterol... The sides we ordered for the table were all delicious. Mushrooms & creamed corn were probably the best. Creamed spinach and gratin were just okay. I tried some of my friend's chicken. It was pretty good, but the sides it came with were the most impressive. \n\nAs expected from a nice steakhouse such as this, the service was excellent.",

I was here for a couple friends' birthdays, and everybody at my table ordered one appetizer to go with the steaks we ordered.  As good as everything was, we just ended up staring at our food 20 minutes after being served.\n\nAs for the food, as I stated, it's all terrific.  The complimentary bread is some of the best I've ever had.  They're delicate to the touch, and when you bite into it, the texture is flakier than a croissant.  I didn't even know that was possible with a roll.  \n\nI had the lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was creamy and some decent chunks of lobster in it.  For the record, I actually finished it.  Another person at our table ordered the seafood tower which is something you should get on a big baller budget, but everything from the oysters, to the lobster, and crab claws were scrumptious.  The country smashed potatoes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, truffle parmesan potato chips, and duck fat fingerling potatoes?  All amazing.\n\nNow, the steak.  Most of them are dry-aged, so we're talking $$$ here, but like my fellow Yelper Ferdinand L. said, do not attempt to have a steak without the foie gras on top.  If you've never had foie gras before, this is the time to do it.  The result is something you'll simply salivate over.\n\nNow it wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was one of those situations where after eating here, I know most things after will be a disappointment, so choose your next meal wisely.  My whole table had the meat stares, and only one person at the table finished their entree.\n\nJust a great dining experience.",

They were all quite tasty! \n\nThe BF and I shared a Bone-in Ribeye. Asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. I was disappointed since I really hate eating well done meat. Luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or I'd definitely have to have it recooked. I also had an addition of seared Foie Gras as well - which was the absolute BEST part of my meal. The flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, I found myself wanting more still!\n\nAlong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: buttered asparagus, buttered broccoli, creamed spinach, sauteed garlic mushrooms, mash potatoes, creamed corn gratinee, and potato gratin. All the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. I loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nAs full I already was, I saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course I couldn't pass up on that.

We all had a really tough time deciding on the dishes since everything looked and sounded incredible. Out waitress was on top of her game and cheerfully provided her recommendations to the group.  We ended up ordering a mix of entrees/ sides/ starters/ cocktails/ wine and sweets including a handful of Bone-In Rib-eyes (check out the photo- holy guacamole..) Bone-In NY Strips, Twice Baked Potatoes, Asparagus, Wild Mushrooms, Potato Au Gratin, Lobster Bisque, Wedge Salads with blue cheese crumbles, Banana Cream Pie, and coffee to top it off. \n\nMy guests and I were blown away by the food and service experience. Our favorite dish of the night was, you guessed it, the Bone-In Rib-eye steaks. They were seasoned perfectly with an awesome rub with hints of Cajun inspiration and topped with dab of butter. Yum. It is the best steak I've had to date. Simply divine! \n\nThe sides were large and intended to be shared and passed. We enjoyed the classic steak and potato combos and broke it up with some mixed green salads, asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. We stuffed ourselves in a Thanksgiving fashion and had a wonderful and memorable evening. \n\nI will undoubtedly be returning for another amazing experience in the future! Kudos to the entire staff for making this an amazing dining experience!",

					"text": "This review is actually an average of two visits. \n\nFirst visit was back in January of 2013. My friends and I decided to have dinner at delmonicos to spoil ourselves. We were in Vegas for the CES convention so the place was pretty crowded. We had to make reservations in advanced just to make sure we got a table.  \n\nSo what did we get? Bone-in Rib Eye. It was delicious. It was tender. It was juicy. It was pretty much the best steak I've had so far in my short life. The flavors were amazing and the seasoning was just right.. \n\nThen came dessert. I do believe my boyfriend and I had a cheesecake. It was so rich in flavor. While my friends, they had banana cream pies and one had bread pudding. Needless to say, we were very happy. The price was definitely worth it.\n\nService: N/A\nFood: A+++++ \n\nHowever, our second visit in August 2013, everything wasn't what we remembered it to be. The steaks were disgustingly different. They were dry. They were rough. I ordered a medium rare and it came out medium. It was NOT tender. It took a lot more effort to chew than it should for something that's $52. There were NO flavor in it and the seasoning was quite lacking.\n\nWhat the f*ck happened?!?!!!??!!! The steaks tasted like they were fresh steaks versus the dry aged ones that they advertised. \n\n\nTHEIR SERVICE IS FANTASTIC AND IMPECCABLE. \n\nWe had brought up the issue with one of the servers and the manager of the location, Doug, took care of us. My friend's steak, and so was mine, was done three times to see if we were happy with the results. My friend's steak was pretty much rare when she ordered medium rare so they tried to correct that for her. They took the steaks off the check and gave us complimentary desserts. \n\nEven though they tried to correct my steak and even though they had amazing service, I'm not sure if their quality control is at work anymore. The quality was a good 180. The piece of meat they gave me was comparable to a $20 steak from Outback or any other random cheap joint versus the $52 price tag. It could be a bad batch, it could be quality control, but I'm not sure if I'd return to the location.\n\nService: A+++++\nFood: F",

However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.\n\nIt was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...\n\nThe wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.\n\nNow on to the steak.- the \"signature\" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend's filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?  Call this half a strike.\n\nNow on to the pecan pie and ice cream thingy - yummy. Best part of the meal!\n\nAll in all, Emeril's Delmonico is not bad.  Just that I was expecting more...",

					"text": "Top notch steaks and one of the best wine lists in Las Vegas. Perfectly seasoned and prepared steaks in the main dining room makes for a great night out, but what makes The Delmonico Steakhouse a DESTINATION is their individually planned and prepared tasting menu, available during an evening at their special Kitchen Table. \n\nThey have a glass room with space for 8, connected to the kitchen where you'll enjoy a special tasting menu prepared by the Chef on duty. And when I say special menu, I mean just that. Chefs are passionate about menu planning and specialty food and they'll give you a 6-8 course meal featuring the steak of course, and many other things not available on their menu, finished with a dessert tray to die for, featured every one of the desserts they offer. \n\nThis is an Emeril restaurant but you won't see any made for TV dinners here - it's truly an authentic steakhouse with an upscale dining room. For the wine lover, Master sommelier Kevin Vogt will work with the chef to perfectly pair wine with each course. What is special, as of my last visit, is The Delmonico Steakhouse runs independent of the other food services at The Venitian. This means they shop for their own food and manage their own wine collection. So if you enjoy fine wine, perfectly paired with your meal - this is the place for you. \n\nThis is my #1 all time favorite restaurant. The food is good enough to stand on its own, and because of the special treatment you get at the kitchen table, I've yet to experience anything so great.\n\nHow much? You'll be shocked and surprised to learn this dining experience isn't terribly expensive. For a little more than you'd spend in the dining room, you get a personal dining experience, about $85 for dinner and wine pairing for about $65.\n\nI call this a once in a lifetime experience, even though I've been lucky enough to do it about ten times.",

I was given two wines to try based on my meal choice, and stuck with an Aussie Syrah that was to die for. \n\nWe were given no attitude when we told the server that we wanted to share the bone in ribeye($52) which was fab given our desire to try other menu items w/o emptying our pockets completely. \n\nStarted off with the Blue Cheese Apple Salad ($16) which had these grapes (that I originally thought were olives until I bit into them) I can only describe as being totally delicious. \n\nThen we picked the garlic sauteed mushrooms and asparagus for sides (all sides $9) The shrooms were wonderful, lots of flavor and definitely went well with the meat. The asparagus was cooked right, but I would say it lacked flavor, we had to sprinkle salt over it, and that is a downer for me at a nice restaurant. \n\nOur Bone in Rib Eye steak, which was split for us by the kitchen no questions asked, ... except for one \"Who get's the bone?\" \"I Get the Bone!\" I replied! \n\nOrdered along with a side of raw horse radish and their signature steak sauce ... The Rib Eye was cooked to perfection. I order my steak Med Rare (even though I like it bloody) because I've found in the past nicer steakhouses tend to cook on the rare side. True to form, it was cooked amazingly well. Very pink, and extremely tender. Every bite seemed to remind me of a fillet which is unusual for that cut of meat, it just melted in your mouth then, after my date made sure I wouldn't offend anyone by asking if they minded me chewing on the bone like a dog with table scraps ;) - I did just that \n\nI'd also like to mention that if you have a choice, I would ask for Todd to be your server, he was a delight to talk to, and payed us a lot of attention - which is more than I can say for the staff at Stack inside the Mirage :( \n\nOur entire bill was only $110 and we were both full and satisfied.

The service has always been consistently great-call you by name, never a water glass left half full, and servers who know and understand the menu.  The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up!\nEmeril-you've done it right again!\nWe're going to actually try Carnevino, Batali's latest,  on our trip next month for something new, but I know we'll always visit Delmonico's!",

The oysters, ahi tuna & salmon tartare, butternut squash ravioli, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the potato gratin is a good side dish to have the steak with. The wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. I was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. Service was great and efficient. I must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. Pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.",

					"text": "Delmonico's is a great place to dine while staying in Vegas (especially if you are staying at the Venetian).  \n\nService:\nThe distinguishing characteristic here is the service.  We had 10:00pm reservation on Valentine's day and were flying in to Vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  Our flight out of SFO was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  Our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  They key here was she always made us feel like she was on \"our team\" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  She helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in \"before the bell\" (as it were).  She got a $100+ tip for being a pro.\n\nFood:\nThis is a steakhouse, order a steak.  Mine was flavorful without being fatty or gristly, pink without being bloody and just the right amount charred on the outside.  This was the ribeye steak, but the bone-in ribeye ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  My wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).  \n\nCost:\nYou won't find an entree for under $50 and the sides are extra (we had a group of 6 so that actually worked out wonderfully and we ended up dining quasi-family-style).  The asparagus and mushrooms were hits!  With tip (21%), the bill came to exactly $100/person.  I think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.\n\nBottom Line:\nThe service here was friendly and professional.  The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  The food is extremely good and a decent value (it is Vegas after all).  Go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.",

					"text": "Five star food. The service? Not so much. \n\nWhile in Vegas, my boyfriend and I decided it was time to splurge a bit and eat some tasty, tasty cow. We were seeing Blue Man Group that night, and this place was located right next to the theatre. And it's an Emeril restaurant. Awesome, right?\n\nWe were seated promptly for our 830 reservation. I sat down and the guy put my napkin on my lap and stepped on my foot in the process. No big deal; I'm a klutz too. Shortly thereafter, a waiter appeared, informed us that we'd have three servers that night. He then asked us if we'd like bottled or tap water, and then asked if we wanted a wine list. We answered and he went off to take care of it. Not 30 seconds later someone else (one of our other servers, I assume) showed up and gave us the exact same spiel. We answered the same way. \n\nSoon after, the first guy appeared with the wine list, which was literally 25 pages long. Ok, I both love me some wine and understand that this is a nice place, but a wine list that long is overwhelming. Yes, they had a page with Kevin's (the sommelier, I assume) picks, but still. \n\n20 minutes after we received the wine list, our server finally showed up to take our wine and food orders. We decided to split a ribeye and some potato gratin. I also got the gumbo, which was served promptly along with our wine. \n\nAs I said before, everything was delicious. The wine was great, the gumbo was extremely flavorful, the ribeye was tender and wonderful, and I also loved the potato gratin. However, when we got our food, I asked the server if he could give us the check a little early so we wouldn't have to rush to make our show (we were cutting it close, especially with the time it took for the server to come take our order). He insisted we'd have plenty of time and refused to give us the check. This is because he wanted to offer us dessert after our meal. Fine. Whatever. Still annoying. \n\nI'm hoping that this was just an off night, because it seems that most of the reviews here are very complimentary of the service. I'd be willing to give this place another shot, because the food was really that good (and actually kind of reasonably priced for what you get if you split a steak like we did). \n\nSo, we'll see...",

					"text": "It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \n\nThe LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nV&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus. \n\nDrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \"Yes, please, another round\" after flagging someone down.  \n\nThe highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov's dog.\n\nHusband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \n\nWhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \"fine.\"\n\nManagement comped one of the two Tito's I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n\nIn all fairness, the staff at D's did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn't until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \"buyer's remorse\").\n\nSo after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \"satisfy the customer.\" Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n\nI have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \"celebrity\" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It's the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n\nSo, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril's establishments. I doubt I'll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I've left the building and think I'll stick to D's in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me.

We were some of the first customers at Emeril's at Universal Studios here in Orlando, which was OUTSTANDING when it first opened and the first few visits after that.  Then it started going downhill - poor service and bad food.  It was so bad, we swore we wouldn't frequent any of Emeril's restaurants ever again.  Then we were in Vegas and at the Palazzo looking for a place to eat.  We foolishly decided to give Delmonico a try.  Worst service we've had in a long time.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him.  He disappeared after dropping the menus and wine list on our table.  When he finally showed back up and I ordered a glass of wine (he didn't offer drinks when he dropped the menus on the table), I didn't get it for a good 10 minutes.  If I had been by myself, I would have walked out, but my wife didn't want to do that.  Dinner showed up and we started to eat.  My glass of wine ran out, with absolutely no sign of our waiter.  I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for my wine.  Truly pathetic.  Food-wise, I don't know where the other reviewers have been having their steaks, but I have no clue why they would say these are the best steaks they've ever had.

My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.\n\nI love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back. One day I hope to meet Emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.",

The cavernous dining room was so cold, I could see my breath.  After the slow appetizers, our main course took 60 minutes to be served.  Two of us ordered the bone-in filet, both cooked medium rare.  Mine arrived with heavy spices, while the other diners' filet was more aggressively spiced, to the point it had to be sent back for a new steak.  Perhaps this special item was supposed to be spiced up more than a typical filet, but even between the two of us it was inconsistent.  Then the waitstaff disappeared again.  Our 3-course meal for 3 people took over 3 hours.\n\nAsparagus was well prepared, and the Caesar Salad was superb.  But vegetables do not a steakhouse make.  There are other steakhouses at Venetian / Palazzo that have better service and consistently prepared meat.  \n\nThe cavernous design contributed to a loud atmosphere, making conversation difficult -- not just between diners but with the waitstaff.  Our lead server had to ask twice for us to repeat our selection.\n\nI can't recommend this place, nor do I plan to return.",

Not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. You are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area. \n\nWe had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. The seats were very very comfortable. I believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but I guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. Reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party. \n\nOur waiter or host shall I call him was very informative about just about everything! He recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how I should get my steak cooked! He was simply awesome. \n\nI order the BONE IN RIB STEAK which is also originally what the server recommended. The price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. Medium rare was perfect. The steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nso it was very easy to get every last piece off the bone. \n\nI strongly suggest you order the steak with a nice red wine. Your taste buds will be in heaven. \n\nThe sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. For some reason I was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! The side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. I put that to the side because I did not want to share with anyone. The truffle potato chips was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead. \n\nThe calamari was okay. Not worth the $14. Marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly. \n\nTHEY HAVE THE BEST WARM BREAD HERE EVER! TEST YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU CAN RESIST JUST ONE! \n\nI can finally say I ate at one of Emeril's restaurants! Seeing you on the Food Network making all those different mouth watering dishes is for real! Definitely a must try if you are a steak lover.",

We arrived an hour before our scheduled reservation, as we were walking around the hotel, but did not want to wait till 9 o'clock, the time we had our reservation for.  Fortunately, we had no problem getting seated right away.\n\nWe started off with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and full of flavor with large chunks of lobster meat.  For our entree, we each had the bone in rib eye (I had the lobster with my steak) with sautéed garlic mushrooms and country smashed potatoes.  Our steak was cooked to perfection (medium well; pink on the inside, brown on the outside).   Side portions are big enough to share with 2-3 people and even have some left over to take home.  We ended our evening with the duck egg crème brûlée.  My only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   I've had crème brûlée in many restaurants, and I typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.  \n\nI cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at Delmonico!  Staff was incredibly attentive.  They have three servers waiting on you.   They constantly check on you and top your drinks off.  \n\nLike most fab steakhouses, Delmonico is pricey.  With tip, our tab was $300, but it was absolutely worth every penny.  \n\nLike I previously mentioned, our dinner was delicious, but what made our experience even more amazing was the staff.  I have NEVER experienced such great customer service.  \n\nWhen in Vegas and you're craving steak, Delmonico is a MUST!",

I wasn't too sure about visiting Delmonico Steakhouse since there are sooooo many restaurants that I want to try every time I go to Vegas.  I think we've been to almost ALL the Steak houses in Vegas.  CUT and CRAFT.. some of our favorites.\n\nUpon arrival.. we were seated within 3 minutes - which is a GREAT start.  People that know me are well aware that I do not like waiting.  \nWe were directed to a nice booth area and my husband and I were able to sit by each other to \"people watch\". \n\nImmediately we were welcomed by our waiter, Michael Jackson.  We started off with 2 glasses of Chardonnay - Light and smooth. \nSince I wanted to try so many of the sides and apps.. I decided that I'd just share the steak with my husband..  \n\nSooo Here's what we got:\n1. Spinach Frisee Salad with Poached Egg and Candied Bacon\nReview:  I was pleasantly surprised that the poached egg was encased in Panko crust and DEEP FRIED.  The candied Bacon.. Amazeballs\n\n2. Baked Oysters\nReview:  6 lovely oysters Baked with Garlic/parsley/Parmeson  - What's not to love!!\n\n3. Fried Potato Chips with Truffle oil and Garlic\nReview: AMAZEBALLS!!!

					"text": "Amazing steak, as well as some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nMy friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. We ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nWe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in filet mignon with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  We also ordered the truffle parmesan potato chips, as well as the creamed corn gratinee and the country smashed potatoes.\n\nThe first thing to come out were the potato chips. Sadly, for a girl who eats potato chips as her main meal frequently, I couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (I cannot stand stinky cheese).  However, I did at least try ONE, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. However, the parmesan was still prominent, so I watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. I felt as if I was being punished, for some reason.\n\nLuckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were HUGE. It was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  Our server (who's name I forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. He brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  We got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nThe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. I tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and I end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). This one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nThe filet was also very tender.  While we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, I decided to test it out.  The sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. It didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  After urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nThe sides were very good as well. The creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. Definitely a trick I am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nAs great as the food was, I was also very impressed with the level of service. You would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  In addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nFor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than I expected (although I'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). However, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. That is definitely a sign of a great meal.",

I thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. It was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nOur hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. Very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. Meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my Filipino friends said tasted like Filipino bread. It was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. Our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nWe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. I tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. It was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. Tender, flavorful, delicious! I loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. My other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. I loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. We got the country smashed potatoes, the baked idaho potato, and the roasted fingerling potatoes. The roasted fingerling potatoes tasted the best. I thought it was perfect the way it was salted. The other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\nDecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. The bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. The meal was delicious, but I still love Mastro's more! \n\nAt the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). He came FIVE TIMES. It was SUPER annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\nI'd definitely come here again, but after I try other steakhouses in Vegas!",

If you are a garlic lover you must try these mushrooms; we are and we believe we would make a return trip to the Delmonico just to order these again.\n\nWe then split a Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich which featured wonderfully marinated, expertly cooked steak with a horseradish mayo that perfectly complemented the meat. The sandwich was outstanding, and there was no extra charge for splitting it and serving us each half on own own plate. \n\nWe then decided to go for it and split a piece of Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie. This turned out to be not your ordinary banana cream pie in that there seemed to be no cream filling with the bananas. It looked like a vast number of differently shaped banana slices had been stacked on the crust in a kind of patchwork design, and yet they had done something to these bananas to make them deliciously sweet. There was a substantial amount of whipped cream on top of the slice which had been dusted with chocolate and drizzled with caramel. This pie was definitely a winner, and we regretted that we had no more room to sample some of their other desserts. \n\nWe are already planning a return visit to Delmonico Steakhouse next time we are in Vegas to further explore their menu and other items.

So obviously the anchovies were already in it, and since i explained i didnt want them, they made another.   I was told its a fire hazard to prepare it in the bar area so they made it on the side when i wasnt looking.  The few bites i took werent that good.  So i watch them make the 2nd salad in the hallway.  Needless to say, it was totally flavorless, ive had better dressing from newmans own, and the lettuce was in long stems, not even cut up. I was very disappointed with the salad, although the other food looked good",

They overcooked it so much that when I taste it, I almost wanted to cry. It can hardly pass for well done. I was so hungry and I waited 35 minutes for it.

The manager Michael did come by, confirmed that the steak is overcooked and asked if they can take it back. (I cannot wait for another 30 minutes for a new one. Doesn't a customer's time mean anything to you?) This is nice. But when the chef finished cooking my steak, how can he decide this is OK to serve? He must have cared so little about how his customer would think to decide to serve me this. LET ME TELL YOU. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SPITTING IN MY FACE.\n\nPaid 95 dollars for the bill. I am feeling like a complete loser right now. Good thing is at least I came alone. If I have brought my GF, she would think I want a break up.

Atmosphere is stark and old.  Service is attentive but clumsy.  I mean how many people can ask me if my glass of wine is ok - while serving us terrible food.\n\nWe started with an a Crispy Octopus app which was good.  Hubby had the 30.00 Foie Gras app which he says was terrible - tasted like overcooked canned cat food.  Terrible.  Our entrees were th BBQ Salmon and the Fried Chicken.  The Salmon was really just so so - kind of outdated and way too much bbq sauce.  Hubby said the Fried Chicken and waffles were just bland and dry.  When Fried Chicken is 36.00 is had better at least be moist.  (he was just about choking on it.)\n\nFinally - they brought him a baby scoop of Mango Sorbet with a candle for his bday.  Sadly, they actually brought it while I was in the bathroom.  When I got back to the table, they re-lit the candle again.  Awkward.  \n\nFinal bill for two apps, Salmon, Fried Chicken, and two glasses of wine - $250.00\n\nSo - definitely will not be returning anytime soon.

It's flavorful, PERFECTLY seasoned, and absolutely perfectly cooked.\n\nYou see, this queen is picky.  She doesn't like to eat anything bloody. It's gross to her.  So she always ALWAYS gets her steaks well-done. While some may gasp in horror (how can you enjoy a steak WELL DONE?!), I say this, \"It is true that well-done steaks tend to be dry and flat in flavor. If a steakhouse can manage to make my WELL-DONE steak juicy and flavorful, then FOR SURE it's a fantastic place!\"\n\nI don't remember much about any of the sides because I'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  Many a late Las Vegas night, I'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just CHEW on a slab of leftover steak.

They had like 5 servers placing a dish in front of each person. We also got free crabcakes which was really nice of them. Now the food. Man yes it's expensive but SO WORTH IT! I mean you get a lot of food and the food is so freaking good. I have never tasted a ribeye steak greater than this one.

We made reservations for 10:00pm on the Friday we were all scheduled to arrive. We were all coming seperately from different airlines and different cities and planned to meet at the airport and head out. I. WAS. PUMPED. Super damn excited. \n\nAnd then my flight was delayed. I hate Southwest-- this is what happens when you try to be cheap but still end up paying $250 to fly for half an hour from LA to Vegas. My flight was delayed and delayed and I started to really worry. I worried in the terminal while I nervously sipped my venti coffee. (I swear I had ordered a tall?) I worried for the TWO HOURS I spent sitting on the plane on the runway, trying with much difficulty to bury my face in Harry Potter 7 while I sat next to a really annoying and \"overly affectionate\" couple. (Seriously... DON'T DO THAT. WTF!? Have you no decency!?! Where the fuck is your mother!??!)\n\nI landed at 10:00, booked it to the cab line, sprinted through the Venetian in heels, and, sweaty, restless, tired, and uncomfortable with my carry-on bag, met my friends at the bar in Delmonico's at 10:20. My entire excursion from my house in Los Angeles to the restaurant in Vegas took 4 hours. I'm pretty sure I could have driven. I wanted to die.\n\nWas it worth it?\nYES IT WAS.\n\nGrey Goose and tonic: strong enough to keep me from death type of worth it.\nBeer and cheese fondue with pretzel bread: salty-cheesy goodness type of worth it.\nOysters Rockefeller: I don't even like oysters and it was worth it.\nTruffle parmesan potato chips: the light, crispy, addicting type of worth it.\nSalad with fresh fried mozzarella: I want to eat this cheese until I gain 400 pounds and have to be air-lifted out of my house type of worth it.\nDry Grilled Aged Sirlion a la Oscar with Blue Crab: I was so full at this point I could only eat two bites of this and it was STILL worth it.\nThree different attentive waiters: I get a little chill when waiters murmur \"Pardon my reach\" under their breath like it's a secret type of worth it.\n\nThe menu looked expensive (around $50 for entrees) but our table, for 4 people with a half bottle of wine, cocktails, entrees for each, soups/slads, and appetizers came out to around $400. It was pretty reasonable for the volume and quality of food we ate, but, really now, $400 is spendy. I won a little bit of money over the weekend, so now I can afford to go back.

CUT has been my absolute favorite place for steak and fine dining for the past five years but we decided to try somewhere new for once.\n\nFood (4): The food was great but I wasn't blown away. I didn't leave the restaurant replaying every bite. We ordered the heirloom tomato soup (with grilled cheese sandwich), mac and cheese, crab legs, and two steaks. I got the special steak of the day that came with shaved pieces of truffle on top. Don't get me wrong. Everything was delicious and I had no problem with my food, but it just wasn't memorable. \n\nAmbiance (3.5): It's a fancy restaurant but felt like any other bougie restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel. We were seated at a corner table but there definitely could have been some more space between us and the pair next to us.\n\nService (4): Service was also a positive experience. Our waiter was pleasant and friendly and made small talk with us. And when my date found a long curly hair mixed into his crab legs, the waiter apologized and took it back without a second thought. When he came back with a new plate the legs looked like they came from the fattest crabs possible.\n\nSo overall, a wonderful experience and I would have no qualms about returning.

					"text": "Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\n\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn't the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\n\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\"Would you like some more bread sir?\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \"Better!\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\n\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\n\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\n\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.

Then he proceeded to ask for my address so that they could send a gift card.  I was like ok sure.\n\nI was surprised that the gift card was for as much as it was.  It was very generous of them.\n\nOn to the visit where I actually got to eat!\n\nThe mister and I came during lunch time on a Sunday.  Again, the hostess was nowhere to be found for the first 5 minutes or so.  Then she comes out and is like there is going to be a wait (I had reservations, yet again.)  So we sat at the bar, where the very attentive (and I guess new) bartender proceeded to hand us menus.  Then we were like ehh we'll just eat at the bar.  A couple minutes later, the hostess was finally like oh ok are you guys eating here?\n\nWe started with the Potato Chips with Truffle Oil and Parmesan MMMMM!!  For my entree, I had the Gulf Shrimp with fettucine and preserved lemon.  The shrimp was very juicy and fresh-tasting.  The bartender, who ended up being pretty much our server was very nice, attentive, and actually really fun to talk to.\n\nSo despite the initial situation, four stars for the delicious food, service at the bar, and the lengths the management went to make up for the mistake.",

Now the unique style of your meal will be a delight in being the flavor of your steak or the style in which the meal is plated! I have eaten in many steakhouses and still yet nothing compares to Mastros, the ultimate steakhouse in the United States!

My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary, which eating at a fine dining steakhouse is becoming the annual tradition.  \n\nI had made a reservation, and when we arrived, we were greeted numerous times from several different people offering congratulations on our anniversary.  This made everything seem special for my wife, who had no idea we were coming here.  Then we were taken to our table.\n\nWe were given a near endless wine list (book!) and expected to decide from there?  No, the sommelier came over and determined our wine for us, and did not pick the most expensive bottle, but one of the best ones we have had, for way less than the next closest we had drank a while back.\n\nThe menu is not too over the top, but just right.  I wanted to have the escargot, but my wife cannot bring herself to eat this, so we had the BBQ shrimp.  Being from Texas, we love barbeque, but this was different, and superb.  Four huge shrimp covered in a sauce that I have never had the likes of before.  Our main entrée was the Chateaubriand cooked tableside.  I enjoy my steak rare to med-rare, but my wife does not like to see blood in her steak. (I know, I'm working on this)  They were able to cook the same piece of meat to my liking as well as hers and it came out perfect.  Not a thing was left on either of our plates. \n\nWe concluded the meal with two desserts, I had Emeril's banana cream pie.  An incredible end to a wonderful meal.  My wife had the crème bruele,  and explained it in details I have never heard her use to explain food.  On top of this, we were given a small sample of sorbet with a happy anniversary not written in chocolate on the plate.\n\nThere were so many waiters and helpers taking care of our every need that it was almost impossible to say who was the actual waiter, although the main waiter was superb.  He took over for the cook at our table because he knew exactly how we wanted the steak, and never did he let anything sit out of place, no drink ran low, and not one thing was missed.\n\nAgain, amazing can not explain how great this meal was.  We will definitely stop again next time we are in Vegas!\n\nI knew how much it would be before we went, but for the sake of a review, I will say our meal for two was right at $300, but well worth it.

High quality, beautiful cut of steak, perfectly cooked with a unique flavor profile-- how can you go wrong??  Also, our awesome server sliced it for us to make it easy to share-- loved that!! \n\nThe salmon was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The hash underneath was great too, and played well with the fish seasoning.  The mushrooms side is OUTSTANDING!  If you are a mushroom lover, these are some don't-miss shroomies.  We also got the buttered broccoli.  It is totally simple and tasted like what you'd have at home, but with such a heavy and strong flavored meal, this was some spot on, solid freshness, too.

There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.\n\nFor starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand. \n\nFor dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.\n\nThe waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) \n\nThe manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. \n\nFor the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. \n\nThe bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!\n\nMy filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon. \n\nDesserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it. \n\nMy only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as \"the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for.\" \n\nI personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience. \n\nIf this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.",

The reason being the ration of fat to meat was a little high- i do like marbled fat in the steak but when 1/3 of the steak is fat...i couldn't eat it w/o thinking of clogging my arteries.  Wine was exception- the Italy-\"Vertigo\" was yummy.  The best experience for me was spending it w/ my girl-riends esp for her 30th B-day! the service makes you feel grown up and independent!.

					"text": "TL;DR: Decent steakhouse that matches its price tag; what you might expect in 5 star Vegas hotels. Not a bad option if you have $60 to drop on steak. \n\nWhile this steakhouse might not be anything noteworthy apart from the celebrity status of its owner, Emeril Lagasse, it serves solid food for an albeit expensive price. To be fair, though, we need to recognize that it is located in a 5-star hotel on the Las Vegas strip, one of the most tourist-saturated areas on Earth, where you can expect to be overcharged for everything. That being said, this steakhouse does what every steakhouse should to a fair standard.\n\nThe service here is as good as you would expect at a fancy steakhouse. The free bread here is unusual, though; it seems to be a hollow roll formed by a shell of Pillsbury croissant dough, which isn't bad, but isn't especially good either. USDA Prime steaks go for around $50-$60, and are enough to feed 2 people, or one really hungry person. I ordered the steaks medium-rare, and they were cooked to order, maybe a hair closer to a medium. The steaks had a good charred crust, a mark of a good steak and something difficult to achieve at home. They offer two complimentary steak sauces, both of which pair well with the steak. I'm personally a fan of ribeye steaks and recommend that cut above anything else at a steakhouse like this one. Sides are typical, and the asparagus was nothing special but good as it was. \n\nWhile Emeril may never have set foot in this steakhouse, it certainly does not disappoint. While it may not be as great as some of the most famous steakhouse in NYC, Delmonico does a good job at serving beef in the middle of a touristy destination. While it probably isn't worth more than the effort of a short walk to get to, if you're staying at the Palazzo or Venetian and are looking for a fancy steak dinner, this restaurant is a solid option.",

This place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.\n\nNow let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. \n\nSo they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT! \n\nThen it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? \n\nAnd as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place. \n\nThe restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.  You get ONE chance to make your reputation, and Mr. Celebrity Chef, you lost it here.  AWFUL PLACE!  GROSSLY OVER PRICED!  DON'T WAIST TIME OR MONEY HERE!",

In those travels I go to a large number of steakhouses, many are wonderful, some are unimpressive, a few, well a few are just unbelievable.\n\nService is never the biggest scale tipper for me, but I understand it is very important for some people.  The service at Delmonico is impeccable.  Dishes are cleared away quickly, menu items are explained in necessary detail, drinks are always full, and complaints are addressed quickly and quietly.\n\nDecor generally means little to my review.  I appreciate aesthetics as much as the next 30-something, but a bare room with nothing on the walls isn't going to change my number of stars, and to be honest, I couldn't even tell you what Delmonico looks like on the inside, I don't care, the only thing that matters is those steaks.\n\nI prefer my steak in the form of a ribeye.  Bone-in or boneless, I don't really care.  I order it rare+ with a hard sear (some may call it Pittsbugh, sometimes I do).  At Delmonico I got myself the boneless ribeye, rare+ with a hard sear, and they brought it to me rare+ with a hard sear.  This was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten in my life.  It reminded me of the first time I ate at a real steakhouse when I was in my early 20s, it caused this awakening inside of me, of what I may have been missing in the world.  There was a crunch as you cut into it, and then a soft slide through buttery, perfectly cooked meat, with a hint of salt once you put it in your mouth.  I'll eat at Delmonico every time I go back to Las Vegas.\n\nThere were sides too.  I don't remember what they were.  I don't care.",

					"text": "My family was in town this weekend and wanted to go out for breakfast around 9 on Sunday morning. This is earlier than I would normally be up, but since my parents are early risers, I wasn't going to argue. After my Mom looked at the menus of a couple of places that had generally positive reviews (she's allergic to milk, so we like to make sure she has plenty of choices before going somewhere, more on that later), we settled on Sunnyside.\n\nOur group of six was seated immediately upon entry, presumably due to the fact that it was still so early. It definitely got busier as time went on, although by the time we left (around 10:30), there were still some empty tables. The service was fast and friendly, and our coffee cups never sat empty for long. The food itself was delicious, and the portions were substantial - great value for the price! I ordered an omelette and I felt satisfied upon finishing it, a good sign considering my voracious appetite.\n\nWhen my Mom notified our server about her allergy, she was told that they usually cook with some type of oil/grease that contains dairy (I can't remember the name of it), but the server indicated they'd have no trouble accommodating her restriction. When our food arrived, my Mom noticed that her meal wasn't as hot as she would've liked, presumably due to the fact that the cooks prepared her plate in advance of the rest of us. I also noticed that other people, who were seated and ordered after us, received their food before we did. I'm not sure if this is considered a faux pas, but when I worked in a restaurant, we made absolutely sure to avoid doing this. If it weren't for these two minor complaints (and moreso the first one), I might have given the place 5 stars, and if I could, I'd probably rate it 4.5 rather than 4.\n\nI could definitely see myself returning, and won't hesitate to recommend this spot to anyone else!",

					"text": "Review for Bourbon, BBQ & Banjos, on 11/14 at DLVEC, 200 S. Third Street\n\nTL;DR - The food was delicious but the event is poorly run and needs to work out some serious kinks. \n\nPros:\n- The food was grrrreat (ribs from Atlanta FTW)\n- The live music was pleasant \n- There were tons of (empty!) bathrooms\n\nCons:\n- The check-in process. The tickets say 6-8p, but you spend about 20-30 minutes trying to get in the gate. They didn't use scanners and they let the line roll around the block with very little security and direction. Once we get to the front, they don't look at the tickets, just toss them to the side and go into how to vote for People's Choice, which is causing the huge backup in the line. Here's an idea -- Team One: SCAN THE BARCODES and get the people in the gate; Team Two: hand out the token and a quarter sheet that says \"put this in the voting box of your favorite ribs\" or tell people just that; Team Three: guest info booth inside the event for people who require additional support. \n\n- Bait and switch: nowhere did we read that you get only 5 selections. With 40+ BBQ teams out there that's ridiculous. Make the portions smaller and let people try more. It immediately skews the voting (feeling bad for the SC and GA folks in the back corner) and it's just shady. Spell it out EVERYWHERE and let guests know what to expect. \n\n- Bait and switch 2: they talk about tasting and pairing bourbon, which is almost a lie. You get two tastings (i.e., shots), nothing is \"paired\", and they ran out almost immediately. Utter nonsense. Maybe try inviting breweries next year? Beer and BBQ go well together, no? Or at least try stocking the bars correctly. \n\n- The bars were understaffed and lines were long; felt terrible for the bartenders and annoyed for all the guests.\n\n- Organization: what a waste of space. Move those teams closer to the stage and create an energy around there!! The music was almost an afterthought, which was so sad. SET UP SOME TALL PUB TABLES near the stage if nothing else. Create a social atmosphere...the spaced out floor plan just took away the fun that this should've been.\n\n- Provide napkin and wet-nap stations. It's ribs, you guys...think about your guests. Get a sponsor for it and set it up. \n\n- Where were all the people? We love food and travel often, we only stumbled upon this while doing research for our trip to Vegas. It's so sad that the turnout was so small. Market this thing and get people out to enjoy!\n\n- Lastly, $3 for the tiniest bottle of water *in life* was offensive, just saying. \n\nAll in all, this was our least favorite food festival/event from an execution standpoint, but hot damn if the food wasn't awesome. This could be epic if they figured out how to run the thing. :-/ Fingers crossed!!",

					"text": "I returned to the World Food Championships in downtown Las Vegas, this time with Diane in tow.  At the 3rd Street Stage we saw a mouthwatering demonstration by Heather Walker on behalf of The Happy Egg Co. of how to make a Lemon Praline Genoise, the Lemon Curd of which she reported had some of its origins dating back as far as the reign of France's Louis XIV.  When I heard this I could just picture the monarch on his throne gaining more weight from indulging in a single slice of this carb--, cholesterol-, and sugar-laden cake.  When done it held in its gooey goodness 6 sticks of butter, 20 eggs, and who knows how many cups of sugar?  Sounds more like a food bomb!  But, when completed, with its lovely White Buttercream Frosting and pool of bright yellow Lemon Curd mounted on top, the dazzling dessert looked like a truly luxurious treat.  Alas, spectators did not get an opportunity to taste this sweet confection.  But for just watching the event we did receive nice-looking and useful spatulas, and plush chickens for our two granddaughters, courtesy of The Happy Egg Co.\n\nWe also sampled a cooked pork belly from another demonstration, and walked to the DLV Center where we unfortunately saw little of interest.  We probably arrived at a lull in the action.  Had we been hungry at the time we could have availed ourselves of the tempting-sounding offerings of Baby's Badass Burgers Food Truck.\n\nBut, for me, the Kenmore Kitchen Coliseum was the most happening place.  Here we watched--more like smelled--much of the culinary action occurring during the Preliminary Round of the World Seafood Championship.  The scent of chowders mixed in the air with the briny freshness of crab legs being spread like spokes on the edges of a Seafood Salad, while lovely orange slabs of salmon could be observed being cut with chef's knives prior to grilling.  And gas grills were present in abundance--all Bull outdoor grills, like the one we have in our California home, which I consider to be one of the best purchases we ever made.  We didn't get to sample any seafood either, sad to say.  But when we went directly from Fremont \nStreet to the D Grill  for dinner, we were certainly ready to dine.  \n\nUnfortunately, after a multi-year Vegas run, the World Food Championships is moving on to Florida next year.  But hopefully this culinary competition will return to Sin City soon.  And when it does, I will definitely be back to watch some of it, and smell more fresh food cooking on grills!",

					"text": "I was really disappointed in this event. I bought the so-called V.I.F. (Very Important Foodie) pass for $275 for myself and a friend because it said it covered all but one major event. Upon arrival, none of the Information staff (volunteers) knew anything about it. I had also signed up to judge and was sent to The D Hotel, 12th Floor WFC Command Center. No one there knew anything about scanning my receipt in order to receive my passes. I expected at a minimum to be given an itinerary of events, times and places. Nope. Those were only provided to official staff. \n\nThe opening reception was ridiculous. It was held on the rooftop of the DLV and there were probably close to 1000 people there. There were lines to get to the bar for the \"free\" but awful wine, 8 oz beer in a plastic cup cost $7, mixed drinks were more. The servers were mobbed as they came into the crowd so if you weren't poised to strike as they came out, no food for you. I was able to snag a chicken stick (no satay sauce), a meat/mushroom puff, a mini-eggroll and a cocktail pig in a blanket. Wow! I did mention that this the World Food Championships we're at, right?\n\n I was told that the only judges meeting would be just before my event.  I asked exactly where and when my judging event was and was told to report to the judges tent an hour ahead of time. When I did, I was told to come back an hour later. Coming back at that time, I damn near missed my event. The judging itself was fun, albeit too brief. All the food that's prepared for the judges and is not eaten is thrown away. Can't share with anybody or bring back to your room or anything.\n\nI was asked to judge a second event, the Chili Cook-Off. Unfortunately, when I arrived to do so, they were running way behind (like 2 hours), so it was going to conflict with the judging class I had signed up for and that was part of my $275. So off to class I went. In general, it was provided to certify judges in the E.A.T. methodology that WFC uses. It's a good system, fair to contestants, and if adopted by other culinary challenges could turn out to be like the tasting rules for Kansas City BBQ cook-offs. The class however should have been given BEFORE anyone judged anything and at a time when it didn't conflict with tasting events.\n\nThere were some celebrity chef show-downs that were kind of fun to watch, and the Bourbon, Banjos and BBQ event had some great BBQ, but again, was very poorly done. Anyone could pay $5 and get the same exact thing that my $275 pass entitled me to: 5 tasting chips and a poker chip to vote on my fave. Really?\n\nDid I mention that the last 2 days are celebrity judged only? Yup. When it gets down to the top 10 in each category and the total top 10, only celebrity judges make the cut. That basically means that the last 2 full days of the event are a waste of time for the general public.\n\nIn general, this event could be truly great, but is instead pretty ho-hum except for the contestants and celebrities. Even the volunteers got more out of it than I did, a paying customer. At least the volunteers had a schedule and itinerary they could refer to, they got to try a lot of food and they had something to do all the time. If I go again I will certainly NOT buy the pass.",

					"text": "This will be the last year this event will be held in Las Vegas:( I was fortunate enough to enjoy and be a food judge for all 3 years. It had moved from Ballys to Downtown Las Vegas. There was always plenty to do, see and sample. There were vendors around every turn giving out samples and swag. Demonstrations and chefs cooking could be watched through out the days.\nI agree with a fellow Yelper that the Bourbon, BBQ, and Banjos event was poorly run (not suprised). Line to get in went horribly slow.They ran out of the bourbon they were giving samples of and alot of the BBQ booths ran out of ribs before the event was over. Favorites were The Shed and Lucky 13! There were no tables or chairs to eat your ribs, who was in charge of this!? On top of everything else there was 1 security guard that kept yelling at people even though they weren't doing anything wrong, preaching to them about crossing the street correctly, etc. We just wanna eat and drink! Please leave us alone!\nOver all its always a good time. It will be in Florida next year:(",

					"text": "Disclaimer: I attended the World Food Championship (WFC) as a judge and media member. I also won free admission to the Burger Extravaganza event, courtesy of Yelp.\n\nWhen I first heard about the inaugural WFC, I was immediately intrigued. It's a food competition featuring the best of the best. Categories like chili, burgers, sandwiches, and BBQ are represented. It's all American food, so it doesn't exactly represent the \"world.\" Adam Richman was the perfect host for this event, as everyone knows him from Man vs. Food.\n\nI had a great time judging food. For categories like sandwiches and burgers, the competition went through several rounds of judging. The finalists would then have their food judged by a panel of celebrities and chefs, most notably Adam Richman. As for the BBQ, I thought the samples I had were very good -- all of the BBQ teams are previous grand champions, so they brought their game.\n\nFrom my point of view, I thought that the event was reasonably organized. Something of this size with so many people and logistics involved, I'm sure this took a lot of work to set up. There were a lot of booths from sponsors set up at the front of Bally's right by the Strip, and that attracted the majority of the crowd. The stage up front was perfect to show off demos, music, and announcements. The sandwich and burger competitions were also held at the front of the hotel.\n\nHowever, the energy at the back of the Bally's hotel was dead. It was the area for the BBQ and chili competition. Maybe because it covered so much ground, but most of the time it seemed really quiet. If I was a casual foodie or passer-by, I wouldn't have known about the area, so they probably could've done a better job with putting up signs. Many of the eating and VIP experiences were very expensive -- something that the casual foodie would probably not fork over the money.\n\nPersonally, I had a great time. At the Burger Extravaganza, I got to sample multiple gourmet burgers (slider sized), along with drinks and dessert. I even got to chat with Adam for a few minutes. He's just a normal, cool guy who loves his food and BBQ. Safe to say, his shows on Travel Channel has skyrocketed him to celebrity status. It remains to be seen if they will organize this event next year. If they do, you know where I'll be!",

Probably the worst acrylic nails I've ever had. The nail she repaired fell off a week later, and the polish was so thick that it started peeling off as well. The reason I'm even leaving a review is because it cost $60 for a fill and gel polish; more than I've ever paid for those services in my life. I would never go back and I would never pay those prices ever again, it's ridiculous. This place isn't worth the price they're trying to charge.

I don't but that was the only slightly creative drink on there. Then hoping the food would make up for it, we ordered from the menu.  Actually, we thought it was the bar menu and learned it was the actual restaurant menu.. disappointment number ?  Typical bar food.  So, expecting good bar food I ordered onion rings.  Ooops, sorry, out of onion rings.. what? They can't cut up some onions.. NO, because most likely it is a frozen bag of onion rings.  Ok, I'll try Buffalo wings.  Can't go wrong with that right? Wrong! Another frozen bag with a sad excuse for sauce and watery ranch.. it actually just tasted like milk.

In the middle of our visit a song came on that we liked, and my daughter started to whistle to it. I make fun of her for whistling all the time, and eventually we were trying to whistle to the song together but we're laughing because we couldn't finish one line of the song. Keep in mind we didn't even finish our first drink so we were not drunk at all. We then heard a comment from a bartender who hadn't talked to us since we sat down saying \"no one wants to hear you whistle..\" I thought she said something like \"we like your whistling,\" but she then said something along the lines of \"everyone wants you to stop.\" We were both a little shocked so we asked for our bill. She made another rude comment and that made me even more upset, because there was no reason for it. We then paid our bill and left, sadly I left a dollar tip because of her rude comments but our bartender was good, in fact we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere until the comments from the blonde bartender started. \n\nI can understand if whistling in a sports bar is annoying, but the way the bartender handled the situation was very catty and unprofessional. If she was to ask us to tone it down, or let us know others were complaining (which we did not get that vibe from any of the men at the bar, in fact they were laughing along with us) we would have gladly stopped. \n\nIt felt more like a catty girl moment, and it's disappointing because that was our first time trying out The Bar, and again we enjoyed everything up until the bartender was unprofessional. \n\nAlso, it's a sports bar on a Friday night during march madness...If whistling bothers you that much I hate to think what would happen if people start singing along to a song in your bar.",

She was clearly aware of everything that was happening with my friends and I at all times and offered all of the right things at the right time.  If you visit many bars, then you know how fantastic that is, particularly in Vegas.  Many Vegas cocktail waitresses these days seem to have an attitude of \"I will get to you when I feel like it\" while making you wait till they remember you are there.  Susie was there before I even thought to look for her.  Not just once, not just twice, but over and over again from the moment I got there till I left.  She might be the greatest cocktail waitress I have ever witnessed, and I have visited many bars.  I can't think of a single word except perfection.  Sounds a bit over the top, I know, but I am a service junkie.  I can only dream that every bar I go to has a cocktail waitress like Susie.\n\nThis is coming from a guy who hates gaming bars.  I can't stand them.  Here though, I recieved better service than many upscale bars I attend regularly.  Notably better.\n\nIs that all?  No.  I was hungry and in the mood for spinach.  Yes spinach, I like spinach and on occasion I crave spinach.  A spinach salad at a gaming bar? \"I will just hope for the best\" I thought.  Then it came.  A perfect looking, fresh spinach salad that also had a touch of personality.  Strawberries and glazed walnuts with goat cheese and a maple vinaigrette.  I was astonished how great this salad was, and I am a tough critic with food.\n\nThe only downside to this bar is that it is very far from my home and on the complete opposite side of town.  I hope that the fundamentals that make this place great are maintained and expanded upon with success and new locations closer to me.  The only suggestion I would give is to give your bar and future bars a more unique look and feel to astetically separate them from the mess that is the mass of other gaming bars in Vegas that are no where near your level.\n\nThank you for the refreshing experience.  I wish you great success.",

					"text": "Not wanting to take my negativity to a social media outlet, I refrained from writing a bad review for this place for a few weeks. Then yesterday, visions of that horrific experience resurfaced and got another episode of PTEED (Post Traumatic Eating Experience Disorder).\n\nIn all seriousness, I do feel compelled to write about how disgusting the chicken sandwich I ordered for lunch was, as it is dishonest to sell such repugnant chow. \nImagine going to the 99cents store, buy some type of boiled subpar pre-cooked rubbery chicken breast, cut is up in slices, keep some fat on it, keep it for 6 weeks and serve it cold on a baguette that looks more like a 20 days old gas station dinner roll. Well...it tasted even worse than that. You also pay $10 for the privilege of eating rancid food. \n\nThinking of it, I am not even sure it was chicken or if I was the victim of a joke or the cook quit that day. It sounds dramatic, but I can say that this had to be one of the worst eating experience, because 3 weeks later, I actually still think about it. I get borderline angry when thinking that anyone in their right mind would ever dare serve this vile sandwich. I had lunch there previously a long time ago and things were tasty then. I also had food at their other location lately and it was ok. Nothing to write home about but in all fairness, would not expect sensational food from a bar.\n\nPositive: Bartender was nice and friendly.",

That was all the service we received. Our beer glasses sat empty for over 15 minutes. She walked around the bar several times without making eye contact to us.

I have to say that most of the reviews for this place were absolutely worthless so I really didn't know what to expect.  First off, this place is very dark but that doesn't really bother me.  I can drink beer in the dark.  The beer prices are pretty good.  $3.75 for a domestic 16 ounce and I think $5 for an import.  They also have 22 ounce glasses for only a buck or so more.  They have about 12 beers on tap including Newcastle, Ranger IPA, and another Brown Ale I've never heard of.  Their bottle selection seemed to be a little bigger and I saw they had one offering of Stone, not sure which one.  The waiter for our group of five was on top of it and we drink a fair amount.  At our table we had wings, boneless wings, a bbq burger, a patty melt, tater tots, fries, and nachos.  I tried most of the food and we all seemed to agree that all of it was pretty great.  The boneless wings were a little dry and the sourdough on my patty melt was a little too toasted.  Other than that, we were pretty pleased.  They have a happy hour M-F from 3-6 that seemed pretty awesome.  $2 light beers and some cheap food.",
