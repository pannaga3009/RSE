It's behind the tower suites so you kind of have to look for it on the map or ask the workers to lead you there. It was our last day in vegas and we had resort credit to spend still. We ordered the seafood platter $72 which was AMAZINGGGGG!! We also got the duck ravioli, Prawns plate, Salmon salad and a few other plates. The service here was perfect and didn't come to the table too many times to disturb us. YOU HAVE TO GET THE DUCK RAVIOLI! So delicious!!! I will have to come back here to eat all the other good stuff on the menu but there wasn't one thing that we weren't disappointed about.",1

We paddled the entire day, hiked to the hot spring and more paddling and hiking! Our tour guy, Alex was excellent. He is very knowledgeable, friendly and helped us take pictures along the way. We had Mcdonalds breakfast and some Arby's sandwiches, grapes, crackers for lunch; and an abundant supply of water during the entire trip. Very enjoyable!",0

I think it has a good vibe and good concept but based on what I ordered I think their food is just so-so.  I ordered the turkey meatballs with the classic tomato sauce.  I also ordered a side of Parmesan fries.  The meatballs didn't wow me.  They were very, very dry and didn't have enough flavor.  There was nothing to make me want more.  The classic tomato sauce was okay.  I liked the texture of the crispy fries, but they didn't have much flavor either.  They had parmesan sprinkled on top, but nothing stuck to the fries.  There was also only a hint of garlic. Just not enough flavor.  \n\nIt seems like it would be fun during happy hour, but until their signature meatballs improve, I won't be back.",0

I've been to a lot of these locally run nail salons, but they all seem to lack what this place HAS! Their grand opening was Tuesday, & a friend of mine scheduled appointments for a group of 4 of us to get pedicures (because they were offering a 20% discount for the grand opening). The owner not only remembered her name the entire time, but he made all of us feel so WELCOME. He brought out plates of cheese and crackers along with a bottle of red wine. We most definitely were not expecting anything like this. I mean, come on, what girl doesn't want to be wine and dined? My crew and I definitely ate all of that royal treatment up! \n\nNow onto the pedicure. They offer a menu of different pedicures that you can choose from, but I went for the ""ultimate herbal pedicure."" It consisted of dried herbal leaves of my choice (peppermint & lavender). It was so relaxing, and my tech, Adrianna, was simply AMAZING. She was so meticulous in making sure that I was comfortable, relaxed, and happy with her work. \n\nI was INCREDIBLY happy with her work and will be requesting her again when I return. \n\nThe facility is new, clean, modern and very chic. I know my friends and I shared the same satisfied experience.",4

I have been there a few times, but I do not like eating outside on a patio when its hot and I hate eating in my car.  It makes it difficult to eat there in June, July and August or any day the weather is less than ideal.  I wish they had a salsa bar outside so I could get more salsa or try the other ones.  I also wish they had an outside drink station to get more water or tea.  I do not enjoy standing in line a second time because I am thirsty.

The meat is always flavorful and and tender, and it's topped off with sweet, juicy pineapple, crisp onions, fresh cilantro, and a light and creamy avocado sauce. I also like their Carne asada. I've only ever ordered their tacos, but their menu is vast, so one of these days I may be tempted to try one of their burritos, salads, or elote. I recommend a liter of Coca Cola or a bottle of cerveza with your tacos - they have a huge selection, including my favorites Bohemia and Negra Modelo. \n\nThe customer service is always quick and friendly, their prices are comparable, the tables and dining area is larger than many taquerias in town, and their salsa bar is so stocked, it even has beans on it! Twice we've been there for lunch when La Buena 101.9 FM was doing a live remote, and one time my husband won a pair of tickets to Ricardo Arjona at Planet Hollywood. (Swoon!)

(Dr. Sivarajan under the watchful eye of, I believe, Dr.Patel) Mostly all went very well. Hospital called the day before to make sure that I had good travel instructions. The parking lot is convenient from the street and signage is good from the lot into the hospital. Registration went smoothly. Medical personnel were proficient and friendly. As far as I can tell at this early date, all went as expected. But... In pre-op, the installation of the venous access catheter went awry. Someone please observe and correct ""Amber"". The puncture entry, I believe should go north south, not east west. When the ulnar nerve gets tapped, it is a painful shock. When a patient is in pain from a simple puncture something is wrong. Anyway, in the O.R., the intravenous anesthesia would not flow. She missed the vein and the catheter had to be redone on the other arm; an unnecessary and painful delay. Just an awful way to start.

It's tender and juicy and I eat every last bite. The only aspect in which my C.P. exceeds theirs is the fresh habanero salsa I serve on the side. I'm writing this review from my POV, thus the four stars; however, I made the mistake of recommending the dark mole to a dinner companion, which turned out to be much more earthy, smokey and strong tasting than I recall. Too much char on the chilis, perhaps? I couldn't blame my friend for getting through less than half his plate. (Perhaps this is a matter of personal preference, but I enjoyed the moles in Oaxaca much more.)

We had just ordered, when a woman returned a milkshake that she and her child had both been drinking from to the counter.  She said her child did not like it, and to make it more palatable for her (the mother), she wanted vanilla ice cream added to it. To our surprise, the server took the plastic lid off their drink, poured it back into a metal milkshake canister, added ice cream and proceeded to reblend it. When I told her I thought it was not right to put milkshakes that had contacted their mouths back onto the common blender, she said that she could see my point, and it was not a common practice, but she was doing it ""just as a favor to her"". The immersion blender parts that hang down might be rinsed off, but are not sanitized between milkshakes, and she could not even seem to find any sanitizer around that she could use when we talked about that. We canceled our orders, and I emailed the owners, hoping for an assurance that they would take corrective actions to make sure it did not happen again, but after 3 weeks, no one has gotten back to me. Thus, I have to assume that they do not care. It seems that if they made the milkshake wrong, they should start over with fresh ingredients, and if the customer is just picky, they should still have a policy that is sanitary, rather than contaminating the equipment with someone's half drunk milkshake. Needless to say, we both lost our appetite for milkshakes from this place.",5

Our sommelier was friendly and very knowledgeable and eager to help us choose the wine that would best accompany our taste buds as well as the entire meal we had planned. The food was amazing. There are a few other comparable French restaurants in the Las Vegas area that I usually frequent when in town (out of courtesy I'll refrain from naming names) but this was my first visit to Bardot and it is hands down the best dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. The food was exquisite and everything was cooked perfectly. I tried a little bit of everything but the highlights worth noting (at least for me) were the foie gras parfait, the duck wings a l'orange, the mac and cheese (yeah you heard me right) and the chickpea fries with ratatouille and eggplant purée.

The night before I had called around to different places trying to find a restaurant that provided birthday menus to do something special for my boyfriend.  I called Del Frisco's to make a reservation and spoke with Charlie, who was so pleasant on the phone!  I asked about the birthday menu and she let me know that they wouldn't be able to create one but they could give him a birthday card and a complimentary dessert.  She told me to call in the morning to see if they could maybe make an exception.  I asked her if she could put the birthday card on the table before we arrived and she said sure.  The night of our dining experience, I called to push the reservation back half an hour because I was running late and they made the change with no problem.  When I arrived to the restaurant, I was greeted by the two ladies at the front desk, and I asked if one of them were Charlie, the young lady told me Charlie had gone to place the card on our table. **all smiles**  They seat us and a gentleman poured our water and said our server would be out.  We didn't wait long before Kristin came to greet us and take our drink orders.  Our drinks came back in less than 5 minutes which made me immediately feel good about the service we would receive.  Now, it was hardly busy in there on a Tuesday night, but I've been to small, inexpensive chain restaurants that have been dead and waited 10-15 minutes for a server and another 10-20 minutes for my drink.  Kristin came back, helped us decide on what we wanted to order.  She brought the bread out, our appetizer came, and the food shortly after... She checked on us throughout dinner... Everything was great.  We ordered the marinated shrimp appetizer, I had the crab cakes and brussel sprouts, and he had the lamb chops and spinach, our food was delicious!!!!  We were at the table taking a selfie when a server walked by and offered to take our picture which I thought was nice. Kristin came back out with the complimentary dessert and took a few more pictures of us... and when we were leaving Charlie told us goodbye, remembering our names... All in all, I had a great experience from the time I called until the time I left and I would like to thank everyone I came in contact with that evening.  They definitely helped make my boyfriend's birthday special.  Special thanks to Charlie and Kristin!!!",0

The servers pretty much ignored us, though, and when our waiter deigned to make eye contact with us on his way around the restaurant, he always seemed to be annoyed that we were bothering him asking for a refill and was bristling with impatience when we asked for more meat. He was overly polite to the couple next to us, though, even though they were quite demanding; maybe it was because we were an ethnic minority that night? \n\nFood and drinks took forever to get to us, and the portion sizes weren't consistent. We got a tiny little portion of beef bulgogi, so we asked for more, and the next time the portion was 3 times the size. It made it hard for us to judge how much to order, especially when you're charged extra for leftovers. The food tasted good, but I don't know if it's worth it when there are other Korean BBQ restaurants in the city with staff that don't make you feel like a leper.",0

My fiance & I came in about an hour before closing after walking around Fashion Show for a while. The interior is beautiful and dreamy, with stainless steel tables, dark colors, blue ambient lighting, and a large aquarium that is thankfully not overcrowded with fish so it didn't look tacky. We were greeted, seated, then met by Christa within 5 minutes. She was the right amount of friendly & efficient. She made great recommendations. We were only looking for something light and a drink or two, so I got the tuna tower (wonton crisps on the side) along with a cocktail (forgot the name, unfortunately) & he went with a basic california roll and some Stella. \n\nOur drinks came out quickly and were beautifully presented with waters on the side. Our food took some time but also came out right when we started getting ravenous. I had expected my tuna tower to resemble a messy pile on the plate which I could dig into, but it was much more tower-like than that. It was an underwhelming small dense cylinder of sushi rice, mixed crab meat, avocados, and raw tuna topped with micro greens and roe. It really did look small, but I found that when I took it apart it was well-worth the $16 cost. Because it was so incredibly dense, it filled me up and the wonton crisps were a spot-on recommendation by Christa. I crave it again as I write this. Even the california roll was good. Would definitely get both if I return. We got two more Stellas. \n\nOverall, great experience, a bit pricey but that is to be expected, so we left a good tip. Will definitely come back soon.",1

Goodgrief- that reminds me that their head honcho just did some really crappy stuff back in the ATL and I probably shouldn't shop there anymore anyway. I'll save my politics for later, though. SO- I'm at Home Depot. I needed some boxes because I'm moving (yeh, I swore I'd never pay for boxes but stores crush those things before you can get them!) and I know Home Depot sells them for a decent price. \n\nI stopped by the other day after running some errands, and; mind you this was not anywhere close to closing time. I know when it gets close to closing time people just want to go home! I've been there- don't go into stores when they're about to close people. Don't do it! \n\nUnlike some hardware stores that have a store layout by the entrance Home Depot does not. They should especially considering that if you're female in Home Depot you may have to do some serious work to get some assistance. This has happened to me far too many times to count since moving to OH. It really makes me miss the Atlanta store in Midtown on Ponce de Leon. \n\nMy observations have been that if fully staffed they might have a woman working up at the front near the door and then working as cashiers as well as in the decorating and home renovation center in the back. And maybe the garden center as well. I overheard a woman stepping outside saying that someone had made the schedule for the week who doesn't usually and that she'd been there without a break since noon and was supposed to close (gladly she was headed out on break then around 7-8pm). At least that partially explained why no one was helping me. But not really.\n\nI've become the jerk that yells, ""Hey! Hey Mister!"" - I don't yell! I yell for some dude in an orange apron to help me. Really just to direct me. When I'm schlepping the giant boxes they're not even looking my way as a pair of orange apron dudes walks by me. I might have bought more but they hadn't restocked the shelf so I was having to do some crazy lifting. The store itself is a nice size and has everything indoors for the most part (I understand that's better for the environment because of chemicals during run off following rain?). \n\nIf you really need to go to Home Depot I suggest you head to 10800 Brookpark Rd, Cleveland, OH 44130 and they're far better at customer service than I think just about any other Home Depot I've been to in the area.",3

I admit, I'm not one of those people. \nLast night an old friend and I met at Kama, an Indian place in Toronto's Theatre District. She and I have been many times and the place never fails to satisfy.\nWe met there just before 6pm, and the place was empty. (More naan bread for us, yay!)  But by the time we had sat down to our (ahem) second plate, most of the tables were occupied...our guess was the theatre crowd grabbing a bite before the shows started at 7:30 or 8pm. \n\nWhat do I say? It was an extravaganza of all you can eat Chicken (and Fish) Tikka, Butter Chicken, Channa Masala, Saag Paneer (my personal favourite), plus salads, rice, desserts, naan bread and many other delicacies that are Indian-based and catered to our North American palate. (We all know this to be the truth) \n\nThe food is good.  I know that it's hard to make a dish perfectly when you are making mass quantities of it. And yes, plate presentation doesn't even exist when you are scooping food onto your own plate and in a queue full of people. The wait staff, while busy, were pleasant and always had water available when your glass was running low. The place is clean, big and from what I observed, very popular with locals, tourists and theatre-goers alike. \n\nMy only comment would be that they didn't have Gulab Jammun for dessert.  I was really looking forward to some of that. Also, they served Naan bread when you asked, as opposed to their lunch buffet, when you can take much more than you probably needed. (Well, maybe that's a good thing) \n\nI like this place. I've been going for years and I'm always happy when I leave.

I called ahead to try and place a sit in order before I got there cause we were both meeting there and I only had an hour. The server wasn't rude in his response but told me they don't do that. \n\nI showed up 9 minutes later and when he brought my menus I just gave him my order, so rudeness just quick and efficient. Exactly 5 mins later my food came out steamy hot lol except my friend was running late so I had to wait a good 5 minutes anyways... I definitely snuck a few pieces in my mouth. \n\nOrdered the lunch specials (chili chicken and manchurian beef) both were saucy, flavorful and spicy!  The chicken still had crunch after 5 mins and the beef was really tender. All this plus spring rolls rice and a bottle of water for 5.95 each.. amazing deal!\n\nI need to try their hot and sour soup though!\n\nI'd definitely go back :)",2

I've going a regular for the past fifteen years and while the place has seen lots of changes (especially when it comes to the décor), fortunately the food quality and price have remained unchanged. \n\nWhat makes the Goof such an amazing and successful place is that they don't try to be what they're not. They make simple, fast and affordable food. From Chinese food, burgers, breakfast, Italian food, there's something for everyone here and it's all decent and affordable. \n\nThe staff working here, while not the friendliest at first glance, are very efficient. Give them some time and get to know them a little bit before making judgments. These are extremely hard working people, decent people and kind if you also make the effort to know them. \n\nGreat hours, great location (the Fox theatre is across the street, Ed's Scoop and Chocolate by Wickerhead are nearby), great price, good food.

I've heard great things, so decided to book a reservation to celebrate my birthday. \nWe had a Sunday night reservation at 8:00 p.m.. We arrived promptly at 8:00, and the restaurant was hopping. We had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated...not a problem. \nFirst, let me start by saying the the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside. It has a bit of a Grecian feel, with an upstairs bar, and a dramatic sweeping staircase. There are beautiful chandeliers and horse sculptures. \nWe were seated at a lovely booth, and I was excited to try the wonderful food that I've heard and read about. We were immediately greeted and served homemade pita bread with butter, onion, and basil. The problem was that we had no silverware and no plates. Our server did not explain how to eat the appetizer that he brought, so I asked . I ordered a glass of Malbec, and made do without silverware or a plate, spreading the butter using the little plastic container that it came in. \nAt least 10 minutes passed before the server showed up at our table without my wine. He asked if we were ready to order without asking if there were questions or offering recommendations. I inquired about my wine, and he said it was coming. I honestly believe he forgot about it. \nWe ordered the Barg, which is skewered tenderloin,the chicken Koobideh, which has skewered chicken, and minced chicken mixed with onions and spices , and the shrimp and scallop dish served with Basmati rice. I have to say that the food was amazing and we had wonderful leftovers for the next day. \nThe restaurant was obviously understaffed, and the servers and bussers were overworked. My server had a lot of tables, and his service suffered because of it. \nI landed on a 4 star rating because the food is a 5, and the service we received was a 2 or 3 star at best. I shouldn't have to ask for silverware, which didn't come until after our entrees were delivered . I shouldn't have to wait almost 20 minutes to get a glass of wine when there is a service bar downstairs for the servers. \nOur bill came to $92 with tip on top of the Groupon. It would have been worth it if the service had been on par. \nI will give the Persian Room another chance because I loved the ambiance and the food. I hope that they will staff a little better to accommodate the amount of business that they have.",3

I had to stand my ground, politely, until we got the room we had reserved and paid for. The room was nice and clean. Very comfy feather top bed. One thing, the room is never complete dark due to the drapes not going complete over the shade. So, we woke up earlier than we wanted to. Meaning, waking up after only 3 hours of sleep. By the way...no bath tubs! ""It's in the small print"". The hotel was built without bathtubs. I found this incredibly funny, after my annoyance wore off. No smoking room smelled good.  Another thing - pizza flyers all over the hallways.  Looked messy.  Nobody cleaned them up.",0

The ambiance was not at all indian at all. As I was waiting for the food I couldnt help but notice the awkward room decor. Nothing in this place screamed indian except for the food and the waiter serving us. Anyway I came here on a Sunday evening so on average a good time for restaurants to be busy. Our server was okay so dont expect to be blown away by the service. The good part here? The food. The food was GREAAAATT. GREAATT G R E A T. Okay thats enough but seriously this is one of the second times I've had food by a female chef at a desi joint. When I saw the lady behind the door I was happy. Generally (not being discriminating here) but ladys cooking desi food always makes me happy as they always put the right amount of every ingredient making the food more homely feeling rather then commercial. So there we go! Indian food as close to mama's feel as you can get. Oh and I ordered all non veg food since it was an Indian locals restaurant. I absolutely loved their channa bhatura, naan with palak paneer and rajma daal. Yumm. Didnt get a chance to have any of the drinks or desserts but looked well promising. Definitely wont be my last trip here :) Kudos!!!",0

Every time one of the females got close to us while we were playing with the puppy he would tell them to go do something else because we were his clients, in a rude way.

This dish, in my opinion, is the Thai version of ramen. And it's amazing. I ordered it with chicken breast instead of chicken wings and thighs. Good decision on my part. The broth is very creamy due to the coconut milk, and of course, is curry based. It's some of the best broth I've ever tasted. And it tastes even better if a few limes are squeezed into the broth. It gives off a soft hint of Tom Kha. The noodles are thin egg noodles and you can tell the noodles are cooked in the broth because they also had a ton of flavor. I also felt like there was a fair noodle to meat ratio.\n\nWould definitely come back just for the Khao Soi. It's so tasty. And service was good.",32
